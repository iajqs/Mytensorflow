from the works of the puritan divines bunyan 1845 thomas nelson edition
l garrison the work of his son
i wrote to ballou and he answered me and sent me his works
they have been much talked about simply because they were his work but as tolstoi himself complains they have never been seriously discussed
but the philosophical and religious works of his later years have met with a somewhat indifferent reception
tolstoi's style in his religious and philosophical works differs considerably from that of his novels
he no longer cares about the form of his work and his style is often slipshod involved and diffuse
i mention all this to show the unmistakable interest which such works ought to have for men who make a profession of christianity and because one would have thought ballou's work would have been well known and the ideas expressed by him would lave been either accepted or refuted but such has not been the case
the individuality of the author is felt in every line of his work and even the most prejudiced cannot resist the fascination of his genuineness sincerity and profound earnestness
in entering upon the great work before us we are not unmindful that in its prosecution we may be called to test our sincerity even as in a fiery ordeal
for this we have a succession of christian priests to pray for us and beseech the blessing of heaven on the holy work of slaughter
further acquaintance with the labors of the quakers and their works with fox penn and especially the work of dymond published in 1827 showed me not only that the impossibility of reconciling christianity with force and war had been recognized long long ago but that this irreconcilability had been long ago proved so clearly and so indubitably that one could only wonder how this impossible reconciliation of christian teaching with the use of force which has been and is still preached in the churches could have been maintained in spite of it
but one may at least be sure that his destructive criticism of the present social and political r茅gime will become a powerful force in the work of disintegration and social reconstruction which is going on around us
boston 1838 we the undersigned regard it as due to ourselves to the cause which we love to the country in which we live to publish a declaration expressive of the purposes we aim to accomplish and the measures we shall adopt to carry forward the work of peaceful universal reformation
in these works which are distinguished by the clearness of their thought and eloquence of exposition the question is looked at from every possible side and the binding nature of this command on every christian who acknowledges the bible as the revelation of god is firmly established
of the book what i believe the correspondence evoked by it letters from quakers garrison's declaration adin ballou his works his catechism helchitsky's net of faith the attitude of the world to works elucidating christ's teaching dymond's book on war musser's non resistance asserted attitude of the government in 1818 to men who refused to serve in the army hostile attitude of governments generally and of liberals to those who refuse to assist in acts of state violence and their conscious efforts to silence and suppress these manifestations of christian non resistance
for those interested there is a note at the end of this document that details the adaptations made to this work to fit it into plain ascii text the kingdom of god is within you christianity not as a mystic religion but as a new theory of life translated from the russian of count leo tolstoi by constance garnett new york 1894 translator's preface
the greater number of garrison's fellow workers in the movement for the liberation of the slaves fearing that the too radical programme of the journal the non resistant might keep people away from the practical work of negro emancipation gave up the profession of the principle of non resistance as it had been expressed in the declaration and both society and journal ceased to exist
an exhortation to peace and unity
declaration of sentiments adopted by peace convention
q can he fight in conflict with foreign enemies or disturbers of the peace
the robber the murderer and the cheat will leave them in peace sooner than those who oppose them with arms and those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword but those who seek after peace and behave kindly and harmlessly forgiving and forgetting injuries for the most part enjoy peace or if they die they die blessed
peace then to all who seek peace and may overruling love be the imperishable heritage of every soul who obeys willingly christ's word resist not evil
he came to the conclusion that the establishment of universal peace can only be founded on the open profession of the doctrine of non resistance to evil by violence matt
this declaration came about under the following circumstances william lloyd garrison took part in a discussion on the means of suppressing war in the society for the establishment of peace among men which existed in 1838 in america
if there were a moderately large minority of such men they would exercise such a salutary moral influence on society that every cruel punishment would be abolished and violence and feud would be replaced by peace and love
the subtle intuitive perception of the psychological basis of the social position the analysis of the frame of mind of oppressors and oppressed and of the intoxication of authority and servility as well as the purely descriptive passages in the last chapter these could only have come from the author of war and peace
christ's teaching which came to be known to men not by means of violence and the sword they say but by means of non resistance to evil gentleness meekness and peaceableness can only be diffused through the world by the example of peace harmony and love among its followers
if soldiers thronging from abroad with intent to commit rapine and destroy life may not be resisted by the people or the magistracy then ought no resistance to be offered to domestic troublers of the public peace or of private security
in a whole series of arguments and texts showing that war that is the wounding and killing of men is inconsistent with a religion founded on peace and good will toward men the quakers maintain and prove that nothing has contributed so much to the obscuring of christian truth in the eyes of the heathen and has hindered so much the diffusion of christianity through the world as the disregard of this command by men calling themselves christians and the permission of war and violence to christians
if then the time is predicted when swords shall be beaten into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks and men shall not learn the art of war any more it follows that all who manufacture sell or wield these deadly weapons do thus array themselves against the peaceful dominion of the son of god on earth
attributed incorrectly to john bunyan we deem it proper to state that though the following treatise of christian union appears in nearly all the collected editions of bunyan's works yet its genuineness has been called in question by the rev mr philip in his admirable work the life and times of bunyan
by these so called sects toward expounding the question
the law of state necessity they say can force only those to change the law of god who for the sake of earthly gains try to reconcile the irreconcilable but for a christian who sincerely believes that following christ's teaching will give him salvation such considerations of state can have no force
there is no aspect of the question either on his side or on his opponents which he has not followed up in his writings
that is the question
contradiction between our life and our christian conscience vi
how great the ignorance is of everything relating to the question of non resistance may be seen from the fact that garrison the son who has written an excellent biography of his father in four great volumes in answer to my inquiry whether there are existing now societies for non resistance and adherents of the doctrine told me that as far as he knew that society had broken up and that there were no adherents of that doctrine while at the very time when he was writing to me there was living at hopedale in massachusetts adin ballou who had taken part in the labors of garrison the father and had devoted fifty years of his life to advocating both orally and in print the doctrine of nonresistance
the acceptance of the christian conception of life will emancipate men from the miseries of our pagan life x
but i am a citizen of the democratic republic of the united states and in allegiance to it i have sworn to defend the constitution of my country if need be with my life
the constitution of the united states requires of me to do unto two millions of slaves at that time there were slaves now one might venture to substitute the word laborers the very opposite of what i would they should do unto me that is to help to keep them in their present condition of slavery
the christian conception of life has already arisen in our society and will infallibly put an end to the present organization op our life based on force when that will be xii
and if any mischief follow then thou shalt give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe
e the contradiction between profession and practice and i continue to profess religion and take part in government and pride myself on being at the same time a devout christian and a devoted servant of the government
first i will speak of the information i received on the history of the question of non resistance to evil then of the views of this question maintained by spiritual critics that is by professed believers in the christian religion and also by temporal ones that is those who do not profess the christian religion and lastly i will speak of the conclusions to which i have been brought by all this in the light of the historical events of late years
in affirming my belief in christ's teaching i could not help explaining why i do not believe and consider as mistaken the church's doctrine which is usually called christianity
i knew what had been said on the subject by the fathers of the church origen tertullian and others i knew too of the existence of some so called sects of mennonites herrnhuters and quakers who do not allow a christian the use of weapons and do not enter military service but i knew little of what had been done
it is time to dismiss all these false sentimentalities
a it is shown by the words he uttered at the same time
a no he ought not voluntarily to pay taxes but he ought not to resist the collecting of taxes
in these letters expressing their sympathy with my views on the unlawfulness for a christian of war and the use of force of any kind the quakers gave me details of their own so called sect which for more than two hundred years has actually professed the teaching of christ on non resistance to evil by force and does not make use of weapons in self defense
the novelist has shown in this book the religious fervor and spiritual insight of the prophet yet one is pleased to recognize that the artist is not wholly lost in the thinker
john viii 32 fear not them which hill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
hence we deem it unlawful to bear arms and we cannot hold any office which imposes on its incumbent the obligation to compel men to do right on pain of imprisonment or death
it appears to us a self evident truth that whatever the gospel is designed to destroy at any period of the world being contrary to it ought now to be abandoned
i have promised leaving all else to follow good and through evil to death itself
trying to save his life he loses it
the book i have had the privilege of translating is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable studies of the social and psychological condition of the modern world which has appeared in europe for many years and its influence is sure to be lasting and far reaching
even if there were only a small minority of them they would rarely experience anything worse than the world's contempt and meantime the world though unconscious of it and not grateful for it would be continually becoming wiser and better for their unseen action on it
but he who esteems life more than fulfilling the will of god is already dead to the only true life
the book will surely give all classes of readers much to think of and must call forth much criticism
among the first responses some letters called forth by my book were some letters from american quakers
a of the patriarchs and the prophets contained in the old testament which the hebrews ordinarily call the law and the prophets
the son of william lloyd garrison the famous champion of the emancipation of the negroes wrote to me that he had read my book in which he found ideas similar to those expressed by his father in the year 1838 and that thinking it would be interesting to me to know this he sent me a declaration or proclamation of non resistance drawn up by his father nearly fifty years ago
the dogma that all the governments of the world are approvingly ordained of god and that the powers that be in the united states in russia in turkey are in accordance with his will is no less absurd than impious
having thus stated our principles we proceed to specify the measures we propose to adopt in carrying our object into effect
adin ballou for fifty years ballou wrote and published books dealing principally with the question of non resistance to evil by force
the practical reasonableness of this rule of conduct is shown independently of scripture and all the objections ordinarily made against its practicability are stated and refuted
jesus christ forbids me to resist evil doers and to take from them an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth bloodshed for bloodshed and life for life
christianity misunderstood by believers iv
christianity misunderstood by men of science v
that will not hinder me from being a christian
and i do not for that cease to be a christian
war too is a christian duty
all the ordinary objections to the doctrine of non resistance from the old and new testaments are brought forward such as the expulsion of the moneychangers from the temple and so on and arguments follow in disproof of them all
i know as we all do very little of the practice and the spoken and written doctrine of former times on the subject of non resistance to evil
in addition to what i learned from the quakers i received about the same time also from america some information on the subject from a source perfectly distinct and previously unknown to me
having come to this conclusion garrison thereupon composed and laid before the society a declaration which was signed at the time in 1838 by many members
and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
if we only do it in the spirit of love nothing can be more christian than such murder
it follows that we cannot sue any man at law to force him to return anything he may have wrongly taken from us if he has seized our coat we shall surrender him our cloak also rather than subject him to punishment
immediately after this declaration a society for nonresistance was founded by garrison and a journal called the non resistant in which the doctrine of non resistance was advocated in its full significance and in all its consequences as it had been expounded in the declaration
a it expresses a lofty christian virtue enjoined on us by christ
a virtue cannot be practiced in all circumstances without self sacrifice privation suffering and in extreme cases loss of life itself
besides generally speaking where non resistance costs the sacrifice of a single life or of some material welfare resistance costs a thousand such sacrifices
a christian according to the teaching of god himself can act only peaceably toward all men and therefore there can be no authority able to force the christian to act in opposition to the teaching of god and to the principal virtue of the christian in his relation with his neighbors
q can a christian give a vote at elections or take part in government or law business
one cannot of course anticipate that english people slow as they are to be influenced by ideas and instinctively distrustful of all that is logical will take a leap in the dark and attempt to put tolstoi's theory of life into practice
for every one that forsakes houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for christ's sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life
it is incomparably less dangerous to act justly than unjustly to submit to injuries than to resist them with violence less dangerous even in one's relations to the present life
but while we shall adhere to the doctrine of non resistance and passive submission to enemies we purpose in a moral and spiritual sense to assail iniquity in high places and in low places to apply our principles to all existing evil political legal and ecclesiastical institutions and to hasten the time when the kingdoms of this world will have become the kingdom of our lord jesus christ
contents i the doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force has been professed by a minority of men from the very foundation of christianity ii
chapter i the doctrine of non resistance to evil by force has been professed by a minority of men from the very foundation of christianity
i shall still profess christianity and shall find no difficulty in carrying out my covenant with christ and with the government
the christian has in no case the right to put to death his neighbor who has done him evil or to do him injury in return
since the christian cannot employ violence he is obliged to offer his property at once to the loss by violence inflicted on it by the authorities
hence as a measure of sound policy of safety to property life and liberty of public quietude and private enjoyment as well as on the ground of allegiance to him who is king of kings and lord of lords we cordially adopt the non resistance principle being confident that it provides for all possible consequences is armed with omnipotent power and must ultimately triumph over every assailing force
here is the summary of some extracts from them jesus christ is my lord and teacher says ballou in one of his essays exposing the inconsistency of christians who allowed a right of self defense and of warfare
is it not a christian duty to kill hundreds of thousands of one's fellow men to outrage women to raze and burn towns and to practice every possible cruelty
the quakers sent me books from which i learnt how they had years ago established beyond doubt the duty for a christian of fulfilling the command of non resistance to evil by force and had exposed the error of the church's teaching in allowing war and capital punishment
without here entering into this question we have separately appended it to the works of bunyan in this volume and trust that it will not prove unacceptable to our readers especially considering the efforts that are now being made to promote the living union of all true christians who hold the one lord the one faith and the one baptism
a if only one man acted thus and all the rest agreed to crucify him would it not be nobler for him to die in the glory of non resisting love praying for his enemies than to live to wear the crown of caesar stained with the blood of the slain
he says one man may not kill
thus one chapter in a book of his treats of non resistance in exceptional cases and he owns in this connection that if there were cases in which the rule of non resistance were impossible of application it would prove that the law was not universally authoritative
one word as to the translation
we recognize but one king and lawgiver one judge and ruler of mankind
this declaration of garrison's gave so powerful and eloquent an expression of a confession of faith of such importance to men that one would have thought it must have produced a strong impression on people and have become known throughout the world and the subject of discussion on every side
why is it that one man ten a hundred may not break the law of god but a great number may
one man cannot plunder and pillage but a whole nation can
one may disagree with his views but no one can seriously deny the originality boldness and depth of the social conception which he develops with such powerful logic
but if one smites thee on the right cheek turn him the other also and if one will go to law with thee to take thy coat from thee give him thy cloak also
however one man or a thousand men firmly resolved not to oppose evil by evil are far more free from danger by violence than those who resort to violence whether among civilized or savage neighbors
among the many points in which this doctrine falls short of the doctrine of christ i pointed out as the principal one the absence of any commandment of non resistance to evil by force
no reader can put down the book without feeling himself better and more truth loving for having read it
our confidence is in the lord almighty and not in man
my book was as i had anticipated suppressed by the russian censorship but partly owing to my literary reputation partly because the book had excited people's curiosity it circulated in manuscript and in lithographed copies in russia and through translations abroad and it evolved on one side from those who shared my convictions a series of essays with a great deal of information on the subject on the other side a series of criticisms on the principles laid down in my book
i hardly think that he will have to repeat the complaint in regard to the present volume
tolstoi disdains all attempt to captivate the reader
it is impossible to resist it without having recourse to violence of some kind
true non resistance is the only real resistance to evil
it has been my aim to give a faithful reproduction of the original
many readers may be disappointed with the opening chapters of the book
the history of mankind is crowded with evidences proving that physical coercion is not adapted to moral regeneration and that the sinful dispositions of men can be subdued only by love that evil can be exterminated only by good that it is not safe to rely upon the strength of an arm to preserve us from harm that there is great security in being gentle long suffering and abundant in mercy that it is only the meek who shall inherit the earth for those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword
a he can do nothing of that kind if he wishes to be faithful to christ's law
later on i received a letter from wilson a pupil and colleague of ballou's and entered into correspondence with ballou himself
q but if that is the true meaning of the rule of non resistance can it always put into practice
lord god to calmly and meekly abide the doctrine
having withdrawn from human protection what can sustain us but that faith which overcomes the world
he begins by laying what he considers to be the logical foundation of his doctrines stringing together quotations from little known theological writers and he keeps his own incisive logic for the later part of the book
a great deal was made clear to me by both hostile and sympathetic criticism and also by the historical events of late years and i was led to fresh results and conclusions which i wish now to expound
we shall not be afraid of their terror
a from the command resist not evil
firmly relying upon the certain and universal triumph of the sentiments contained in this declaration however formidable may be the opposition arrayed against them we hereby affix our signatures to it commending it to the reason and conscience of mankind and resolving in the strength of the lord god to calmly and meekly abide the issue
we do not acknowledge allegiance to any human government
the society and the journal did not exist for long
but i say unto you resist not evil
it must be refuted by those who disapprove of its teaching if they do not want it to have great influence
i do not want to agree with these senseless notions of non resistance
a certainly not he cannot take any part in war or in preparations for war
matt x 28 ye have been bought with a price be not ye the servants of men
the interests and rights of american citizens are not dearer to us than those of the whole human race
we ought to oppose evil by every righteous means in our power but not by evil
endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
the spirit of jacobinism is the spirit of retaliation violence and murder
we would be filled with the spirit of christ
wherefore we commit the keeping of our souls to god
to injure another because he has injured us even with the aim of overcoming evil is doubling the harm for him and for oneself it is begetting or at least setting free and inciting that evil spirit which we should wish to drive out
it cannot be affirmed that the powers that be in any nation are actuated by the spirit or guided by the example of christ in the treatment of enemies therefore they cannot be agreeable to the will of god and therefore their overthrow by a spiritual regeneration of their subjects is inevitable
ephesians iv 3 perfection were mentioned of non epigraph
and here is a version of ballou's catechism composed for his flock catechism of non resistance
q whence is the word non resistance derived
non resistance is salvation resistance is ruin
q what is there to show that christ enjoined non resistance in that sense
q wherein lies the chief significance of the doctrine of non resistance
criticisms of the doctrine of non resistance to evil by force on the part of believers and of unbelievers iii
in this way if all kept the ordinance of non resistance there would obviously be no evil nor crime
doctrine of non resistance to evil by force must inevitably be accepted by men of the present day ix
another champion of non resistance has been overlooked in the same way the american adin ballou who lately died after spending fifty years in preaching this doctrine
q ought the word non resistance to be taken in its widest sense that is to say as intending that we should not offer any resistance of any kind to evil
anagram whence is the anagram non pes be deduce
those attester shew not be sooner left disciples
a no it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our saviour's teaching that is not repaying evil for evil
and if in the worst case some members of the minority were persecuted to death in dying for the truth they would have left behind them their doctrine sanctified by the blood of their martyrdom
we believe that the penal code of the old covenant an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth has been abrogated by jesus christ and that under the new covenant the forgiveness instead of the punishment of enemies has been enjoined on all his disciples in all cases whatsoever
i say unto you is written in the gospel resist not evil do not oppose injury with injury but rather bear repeated injury from the evil doer
to extort money from enemies cast them into prison exile or execute them is obviously not to forgive but to take retribution
if we abide evil by our fundamental principle of not opposing evil by evil we cannot participate in sedition treason or violence
we shall not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try us but rejoice inasmuch as we are partakers of christ's sufferings
not only was it unknown in europe even the americans who have such a high opinion of garrison hardly knew of the declaration
but a government or a nation may kill as many men as it chooses and that will not be murder but a great and noble action
evil cannot be supressed by the physical force of the government the moral progress of humanity is brought about not only by individual recognition of the truth but also through the establishment of a public opinion xi
we regard as unchristian and unlawful not only all wars whether offensive or defensive but all preparations for war every naval ship every arsenal every fortification we regard as unchristian and unlawful the existence of any kind of standing army all military chieftains all monuments commemorative of victory over a fallen foe all trophies won in battle all celebrations in honor of military exploits all appropriations for defense by arms we regard as unchristian and unlawful every edict of government requiring of its subjects military service

my government demands from me quite the opposite and bases a system of self defense on gallows musket and sword to be used against its foreign and domestic foes
hence we can allow no appeal to patriotism to revenge any national insult or injury
to resist such evil and to prevent it the evil doer must be punished with death or maiming or some physical injury
a no participation in election government or law business is participation in government by force
if the majority acted thus they would establish the rule of love and good will even over evil doers never opposing evil with evil and never resorting to force

where we read that those disciples which had been discipled and baptized by john were yet ignorant of the holy ghost and knew not as the text tells us whether there were any holy ghost or no though john did teach constantly that he that should come after him should baptize with the holy ghost and fire
the perversion of christ's teaching by the teaching of the church is more clearly apparent in this than in any other point of difference
from hence we may easily and plainly infer that christians may be ignorant of many truths by reason of weak and dull capacities and other such like impediments even while those truths are with much plainness delivered to them
again we read heb

whatever comes from a heart such as his swelling with anger and pity at the sufferings of humanity cannot fail to reach the hearts of others
2d that whoever believeth ought to be baptized
the third thing essential to this communion is a holy and a blameless conversation
1 that believing that the son of god died for the sins of men is necessary to salvation i prove by these texts which tell us that he that doth not believe shall be damned mark xvi
16 john iii 36 rom
x 9 that it is also necessary to church communion appears from matt
xvi 16 18 peter having confessed that christ was the son of the living god christ thereupon assures peter that upon this rock viz
this profession of faith or this christ which peter had confessed he would build his church and the gates of hell should not prevail against it
and 1 cor iii
11 the apostle having told the corinthians that they were god's building presently adds that they could not be built upon any foundation but upon that which was laid which was jesus christ
all which proves that christian society is founded upon the profession of christ and not only scripture but the laws of right reason dictate this that some rules and orders must be observed for the founding all society which must be consented to by all that will be of it
further information as to the ultimate destiny of the society and the journal i gained from the excellent biography of w
hence it comes to pass that to own christ as the lord and head of christians is essential to the founding of christian society
a in the fact that it alone allows of the possibility of eradicating evil from one's own heart and also from one's neighbor's
2 the scriptures have declared that this faith gives the professors of it a right to baptism as in the case of the eunuch acts viii
significance of compulsory service viii
when he demanded why he might not be baptized philip answered that if he believed with all his heart he might
the eunuch thereupon confessing christ was baptized
now that baptism is essential to church communion i prove from 1 cor
xii where we shall find the apostle labouring to prevent an evil use that might be made of spiritual gifts as thereby to be puffed up and to think that such as wanted them were not of the body or to be esteemed members he thereupon resolves that whoever did confess christ and own him for his head did it by the spirit ver
it destroys and in the end extirpates the evil feeling
this doctrine forbids doing that whereby evil has endured for ages and multiplied in the world
3 though they might not have such a visible manifestation of it as others had and therefore they ought to be owned as members as appears ver
23 and not only because they have called him lord by the spirit but because they have by the guidance and direction of the same spirit been baptized ver
13 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body c
i need not go about to confute that notion that some of late have had of this text
but precisely how many are needed to make it permissible
viz that the baptism here spoken of is the baptism of the spirit because you have not owned and declared that notion as your judgment but on the contrary all of you that i have ever conversed with have declared it to be understood of baptism with water by the direction of the spirit if so then it follows that men and women are declared members of christ's body by baptism and cannot be by scripture reputed and esteemed so without it which farther appears from rom
vi 5 where men by baptism are said to be planted into the likeness of his death and col
ii 12 we are said to be buried with him by baptism
all which together with the consent of all christians some few in these later times excepted do prove that baptism is necessary to the initiating persons into the church of christ
3 holiness of life is essential to church communion because it seems to be the reason why christ founded a church in the world viz
our country is the world our countrymen are all mankind
the verdict of the civilized world has pronounced him as perhaps the greatest novelist of our generation
that men might thereby be watched over and kept from falling and that if any be overtaken with a fault he that is spiritual might restore him that by this means men and women might be preserved without blame to the coming of christ and the grace of god teacheth us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts and to live soberly and uprightly in this present evil world tit
ii 11 12 and let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity 2 tim
ii 19 and james tells us speaking of the christian religion that pure religion and undefiled before god is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world james i
27 from all which together with many more texts that might be produced it appears that an unholy and profane life is inconsistent with christian religion and society and that holiness is essential to salvation and church communion
so that these three things faith baptism and a holy life as i said before all churches must agree and unite in as those things which when wanting will destroy their being
and let not any think that when i say believing the son of god died for the sins of men is essential to salvation and church communion that i hereby would exclude all other articles of the christian creed as not necessary as the belief of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment c
which for want of time i omit to speak particularly to and the rather because i understand this great article of believing the son of god died for the sins of men is comprehensive of all others and is that from whence all other articles may easily be inferred
and here i would not be mistaken as though i held there was nothing else for christians to practise when i say this is all that is requisite to church communion for i very well know that christ requires many other things of us after we are members of his body which if we knowingly or maliciously refuse may be the cause not only of excommunication but damnation
but nothing of the kind occurred
but yet these are such things as relate to the well being and not to the being of churches as laying on of hands in the primitive times upon believers by which they did receive the gifts of the spirit this i say was for the increase and edifying of the body and not that thereby they might become of the body of christ for that they were before
and do not think that i believe laying on of hands was no apostolical institution because i say men are not thereby made members of christ's body or because i say that it is not essential to church communion
why should i be thought to be against a fire in the chimney because i say it must not be in the thatch of the house
consider then how pernicious a thing it is to make every doctrine though true the bond of communion this is that which destroys unity and by this rule all men must be perfect before they can be in peace for do we not see daily that as soon as men come to a clearer understanding of the mind of god to say the best of what they hold that presently all men are excommunicable if not damnable that do not agree with them
do not some believe and see that to be pride and covetousness which others do not because it may be they have more narrowly and diligently searched into their duty of these things than others have
what then must all men that have not so large acquaintance of their duty herein be excommunicated
indeed it were to be wished that more moderation in apparel and secular concernments were found among churches but god forbid that if they should come short herein that we should say as one lately said that he could not communicate with such a people because they were proud and superfluous in their apparel
but precisely how many people must there be to make it so
let me appeal to such and demand of them if there was not a time since they believed and were baptized wherein they did not believe laying on of hands a duty
and did they not then believe and do they not still believe they were members of the body of christ
and was not there a time when you did not so well understand the nature and extent of pride and covetousness as now you do
and did you not then believe and do you not still believe that you were true members of christ though less perfect
why then should you not judge of those that differ from you herein as you judged of yourselves when you were as they now are
how needful then is it for christians to distinguish if ever they would be at peace and unity between those truths which are essential to church communion and those that are not
3 unity and peace consists in all as with one shoulder practising and putting in execution the things we do know phil
iii 16 nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule and mind the same thing
how sad is it to see our zeal consume us and our precious time in things doubtful and disputable while we are not concerned nor affected with the practice of those indisputable things we all agree in
tolstoi's genius is beyond dispute
we all know charity to be the great command and yet how few agree to practise it
we all know they that labour in the word and doctrine are worthy of double honour and that god hath ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel
these duties however others have cavilled at them i know you agree in them and are persuaded of your duty therein but where is your zeal to practise
o how well would it be with churches if they were but half as zealous for the great and plain and indisputable things and the more chargeable and costly things of religion as they are for things doubtful or less necessary or for things that are no charge to them and cost them nothing but the breath of contention though that may be too great a price for the small things they purchase with it
but further do we not all agree that men that preach the gospel should do it like workmen that need not be ashamed
and yet how little is this considered by many preachers who never consider before they speak of what they say or whereof they affirm
how few give themselves to study that they may be approved
how few meditate and give themselves to these things that their profiting may appear to all
for the lord's sake let us unite to practise those things we know and if we would have more talents let us all agree to improve those we have
see the spirit that was among the primitive professors that knowing and believing how much it concerned them in the propagating of christianity to shew forth love to one another that so all might know them to be christ's disciples rather than there should be any complainings among them they sold all they had
we love the land of our nativity only as we love all other lands
o how zealous were these to practise and as with one shoulder to do that that was upon their hearts for god
i might further add how often have we agreed in our judgment
and hath it not been upon our hearts that this and the other thing is good to be done to enlighten the dark world and to repair the breaches of churches and to raise up those churches that now lie gasping and among whom the soul of religion is expiring
but what do we more than talk of them
do not most decline these things when they either call for their purses or their persons to help in this and such like works as these
let us then in what we know unite that we may put it in practice remembering that if we know these things we shall be happy if we do them
4 this unity and peace consists in our joining and agreeing to pray for and to press after those truths we do not know
the disciples in the primitive times were conscious of their imperfections and therefore they with one accord continued in prayer and supplications
if we were more in the sense of our ignorance and imperfections we should carry it better towards those that differ from us then we should abound more in the spirit of meekness and forbearance that thereby we might bring others or be brought by others to the knowledge of the truth this would make us go to god and say with elihu job xxxiv
32 that which we know not teach thou us
brethren did we but all agree that we were erring in many things we should soon agree to go to god and pray for more wisdom and revelation of his mind and will concerning us
but here is our misery that we no sooner receive any thing for truth but we presently ascend the chair of infallibility with it as though in this we could not err hence it is we are impatient of contradiction and become uncharitable to those that are not of the same mind but now a consciousness that we may mistake or that if my brother err in one thing i may err in another this will unite us in affection and engage us to press after perfection according to that of the apostle phil
iii 13 15 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you
o then that we could but unite and agree to go to god for one another in confidence that he will teach us and that if any one of us want wisdom as who of us does not we might agree to ask of god who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth no man
let us like those people spoken of in the 2d of isaiah say to one another come let us go to the lord for he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths
5 this unity and peace mainly consists in unity of love and affection this is the great and indispensable duty of all christians by this they are declared christ's disciples and hence it is that love is called the great commandment the old commandment and the new commandment that which was commanded in the beginning and will remain to the end yea and after the end
1 cor xiii 8 charity never faileth but whether there be tongues they shall cease or whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away
and ver 13 and now abideth faith hope charity but the greatest of these is charity
and col iii 14 above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness because charity is the end of the commandment 1 tim
i 5 charity is therefore called the royal law as though it had a superintendency over other laws and doubtless is a law to which other laws must give place when they come in competition with it above all things therefore have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins 1 pet
iv 8 let us therefore live in unity and peace and the god of love and peace will be with us
that you may so do let me remind you in the words of a learned man that the unity of the church is a unity of love and affection and not a bare uniformity of practice and opinion
iii having shewn you wherein this unity consists i now come to the third general thing propounded and that is to shew you the fruits and benefits of unity and peace together with the mischiefs and inconveniences that attend those churches where unity and peace are wanting
1 unity and peace is a duty well pleasing to god who is styled the author of peace and not of confusion
in all the churches god's spirit rejoiceth in the unity of our spirits but on the other hand where strife and divisions are there the spirit of god is grieved
hence it is that the apostle no sooner calls upon the ephesians not to grieve the spirit of god but he presently subjoins us a remedy against that evil that they put away bitterness and evil speaking and be kind one to another and tender hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven them eph
iv 30 32 2
as unity and peace is pleasing to god and rejoiceth his spirit so it rejoiceth the hearts and spirits of god's people
unity and peace brings heaven down upon earth among us hence it is that the apostle tells us rom
iv 17 that the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost
where unity and peace is there is heaven upon earth by this we taste the first fruits of that blessed estate we shall one day live in the fruition of when we shall come to the general assembly and church of the first born whose names are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect heb
so they treated the messiah whose example we are humbly striving to imitate
xii 23 this outward peace of the church as a learned man observes distils into peace of conscience and turns writings and readings of controversy into treatises of mortification and devotion
and the psalmist tells us that it is not only good but pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity psalm cxxxiii
but where unity and peace is wanting there are storms and troubles where envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work james iii
16 it is the outward peace of the church that increaseth our inward joy and the peace of god's house gives us occasion to eat our meat with gladness in our own houses acts ii
46 3 the unity and peace of the church makes communion of saints desirable
what is it that embitters church communion and makes it burdensome but divisions
have you not heard many complain that they are weary of church communion because of church contention
but now where unity and peace is there christians long for communion
david saith that he was glad when they said unto him let us go to the house of god psalm cxxii
1 why was this but because as the third verse tells us jerusalem was a city compact together where the tribes went up the tribes of the lord to give thanks to his name
and david speaking of the man that was once his friend doth thereby let us know the benefit of peace and unity psalm lv
14 we saith he took sweet counsel together and walked to the house of god in company
you see then that peace and union fills the people of god with desires after communion but on the other hand hear how david complains psalm cxx
and the land is filled accordingly with gibbets prisons arsenals ships of war and soldiers
the psalmist here is thought to allude to a sort of men that dwelt in the deserts of arabia that got their livings by contention and therefore he adds ver
6 that his soul had long dwelt with them that hated peace
this was that which made him long for the courts of god and esteem one day in his house better than a thousand
this made his soul even faint for the house of god because of the peace of it blessed are they saith he that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee
there is a certain note of concord as appears acts ii
where we read of primitive christians meeting with one accord praising god
4 where unity and peace is there many mischiefs and inconveniences are prevented which attend those people where peace and unity are wanting and of those many that might be mentioned i shall briefly insist upon these nine
1 where unity and peace is wanting there is much precious time spent to no purpose
how many days are spent and how many fruitless journeys made to no profit where the people are not in peace
how often have many redeemed time even in seed time and harvest when they could scarce afford it to go to church and by reason of their divisions come home worse than they went repenting they have spent so much precious time to so little benefit
how sad is it to see men spend their precious time in which they should work out their salvation in labouring as in the fire to prove an uncertain and doubtful proposition and to trifle away their time in which they should make their calling and election sure to make sure of an opinion which when they have done all they are not infallibly sure whether it be true or no because all things necessary to salvation and church communion are plainly laid down in scripture in which we may be infallibly sure of the truth of them but for other things that we have no plain texts for but the truth of them depends upon our interpretations here we must be cautioned that we do not spend much time in imposing those upon others or venting those among others unless we can assume infallibility otherwise we spend time upon uncertainty
and whoever casts their eyes abroad and do open their ears to intelligence shall both see and to their sorrow hear that many churches spend most of their time in jangling and contending about those things which are neither essential to salvation nor church communion and that which is worse about such doubtful questions which they are never able to give an infallible solution of
but now where unity and peace is there our time is spent in praising god and in those great questions what we should do to be saved
and how we may be more holy and more humble towards god and more charitable and more serviceable to one another
2 where unity and peace is wanting there is evil surmising and evil speaking to the damage and disgrace if not to the ruining of one another gal
v 14 15 the whole law is fulfilled in one word thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
but if you bite and devour one another take heed you be not consumed one of another
no sooner the bond of charity is broken which is as a wall about christians but soon they begin to make havock and spoil of one another then there is raising evil reports and taking up evil reports against each other
hence it is that whispering and backbiting proceeds and going from house to house to blazon the faults and infirmities of others hence it is that we watch for the haltings of one another and do inwardly rejoice at the miscarriages of others saying in our hearts ha
ha so we would have it but now where unity and peace is there is charity and where charity is there we are willing to hide the faults and cover the nakedness of our brethren
charity thinketh no evil 1 cor
xiii 5 and therefore it cannot surmise neither will it speak evil
3 where unity and peace is wanting there can be no great matters enterprised we cannot do much for god nor much for one another when the devil would hinder the bringing to pass of good in nations and churches he divides their counsels and as one well observes he divides their heads that he may divide their hands when jacob had prophesied of the cruelty of simon and levi who were brethren he threatens them with the consequent of it gen
the devil is not to learn that maxim he hath taught the machiavellians of the world divide et impera divide and rule
it is an united force that is formidable
hence the spouse in the canticles is said to be but one and the only one of her mother cant
vi 9 here upon it is said of her ver
10 that she is terrible as an army with banners
what can a divided army do or a disordered army that have lost their banners or for fear or shame thrown them away
in like manner what can christians do for christ and the enlarging of his dominions in the world in bringing men from darkness to light while themselves are divided and disordered
peace is to christians as great rivers are to some cities which besides other benefits and commodities are natural fortifications by reason whereof those places are made impregnable but when by the subtilty of an adversary or the folly of the citizens these waters come to be divided into little petty rivulets how soon are they assailed and taken
thus it fares with churches when once the devil or their own folly divides them they will be so far from resisting of him that they will be soon subjected by him
peace is to churches as walls to a city nay unity hath defended cities that had no walls
it was once demanded of agesilaus why lacedemon had no walls he answers pointing back to the city that the concord of the citizens was the strength of the city
in like manner christians are strong when united then they are more capable to resist temptation and to succour such as are tempted
when unity and peace is among the churches then are they like a walled town and when peace is the church's walls salvation will be her bulwarks
plutarch tells us of one silurus that had eighty sons whom he calls to him as he lay upon his death bed and gave them a sheaf of arrows thereby to signify that if they lived in unity they might do much but if they divided they would come to nothing
if christians were all of one piece if they were all but one lump or but one sheaf or bundle how great are the things they might do for christ and his people in the world whereas otherwise they can do little but dishonour him and offend his
it is reported of the leviathan that his strength is in his scales job xli
15 17 his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal one is so near to another that no air can come between them they are joined together they stick together they cannot be sundered
if the church of god were united like the scales of the leviathan it would not be every brain sick notion nor angry speculation that would cause its separation
solomon saith two are better than one because if one fall the other may raise him then surely twenty are better than two and an hundred are better than twenty for the same reason because they are more capable to help one another
if ever christians would do any thing to raise up the fallen tabernacles of jacob and to strengthen the weak and comfort the feeble and to fetch back those that have gone astray it must be by unity
we read of the men of babel gen xi
6 the lord said behold the people are one c
and now nothing will be restrained from them that they have imagined to do
we learn by reason what great things may be done in worldly achievements where unity is and shall not reason assisted with the motives of religion teach us that unity among christians may enable them to enterprise greater things for christ
would not this make satan fall from heaven like lightning
satan can never be driven out by satan
for as unity built literal babel it is unity that must pull down mystical babel
and on the other hand where divisions are there is confusion by this means a babel hath been built in every age
it hath been observed by a learned man and i wish i could not say truly observed that there is most of babel and confusion among those that cry out most against it
would we have a hand to destroy babylon
let us have a heart to unite one among another
our english histories tell us that after austin the monk had been some time in england he heard of some of the remains of the british christians which he convened to a place which cambden in his britannia calls austin's oak
here they met to consult about matters of religion but such was their division by reason of austin's imposing spirit that our stories tell us that synod was only famous for this that they only met and did nothing
this is the mischief of divisions they hinder the doing of much good and if christians that are divided be ever famous for any thing it will be that they have often met together and talked of this and the other thing but they did nothing
4 where unity and peace is wanting there the weak are wounded and the wicked are hardened
unity may well be compared to precious oil psalm cxxxiii
2 it is the nature of oil to heal that which is wounded and to soften that which is hard
those men that have hardened themselves against god and his people when they shall behold unity and peace among them will say god is in them indeed and on the other hand are they not ready to say when they see you divided that the devil is in you that you cannot agree
5 divisions and want of peace keep those out of the church that would come in and cause many to go out that are in
the divisions of christians as a learned man observes are a scandal to the jews an opprobrium to the gentiles and an inlet to atheism and infidelity insomuch that our controversies about religion especially as they have been of late managed have made religion itself become a controversy
o then how good and pleasant a thing is it for brethren to dwell together in unity
the peace and unity that was among the primitive christians drew others to them
what hinders the conversion of the jews but the divisions of christians
must i be a christian
says the jew what christian must i be
what sect must i be of
the jews as one observes glossing upon that text in isa
xi 6 where it is prophesied that the lion and the lamb shall lie down together and that there shall be none left to hurt nor destroy in all god's holy mountain they interpreting these sayings to signify the concord and peace that shall be among the people that shall own the messiah do from hence conclude that the messiah is not yet come because of the contentions and divisions that are among those that profess him
and the apostle saith 1 cor
xiv 23 that if an unbeliever should see their disorders he would say they were mad but where unity and peace is there the churches are multiplied
we read acts ix
that when the churches had rest they multiplied and acts ii
46 47 when the church was serving god with one accord the lord added to them daily such as should be saved
it is unity brings men into the church and divisions keep them out
it is reported of an indian passing by the house of a christian and hearing them contending being desired to turn in he refused saying habamach dwells there meaning that the devil dwelt there but where unity and peace is there god is and he that dwells in love dwells in god
the apostle tells the corinthians that if they walked orderly even the unbelievers would hereby be enforced to come and worship and say god was in them indeed
and we read zech
viii 23 of a time when ten men shall take hold of a jew and say we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you
and hence it is that christ prays john xvii
21 that his disciples might be one as the father and he were one that the world might believe the father sent him as if he should say you may preach me as long as you will and to little purpose if you are not at peace and unity among yourselves
such was the unity of christians in former days that the intelligent heathen would say of them that though they had many bodies yet they had but one soul
and we read the same of them acts iv
32 that the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one soul
and as the learned stillingfleet observes in his irenicum the unity and peace that was then among christians made religion amiable in the judgment of impartial heathens christians were then known by the benignity and sweetness of their dispositions by the candour and ingenuity of their spirits by their mutual love forbearance and condescension to one another
but either this is not the practice of christianity viz
a duty that christians are now bound to observe or else it is not calculated for our meridian where the spirits of men are of too high an elevation for it for if pride and uncharitableness if divisions and strifes if wrath and envy if animosities and contentions were but the marks of true christians diogenes need never light his lamp at noon to find out such among us but if a spirit of meekness gentleness and condescension if a stooping to the weaknesses and infirmities of one another if pursuit after peace when it flies from us be the indispensable duties and characteristical notes of christians it may possibly prove a difficult inquest to find out such among the crowds of those that shelter themselves under that glorious name
it is the unity and peace of churches that brings others to them and makes christianity amiable
what is prophesied of the church of the jews may in this case be applied to the gentile church isa
lxvi 12 that when once god extends peace to her like a river the gentiles shall come in like a flowing stream then and not till then the glory of the lord shall arise upon his churches and his glory shall be seen among them then shall their hearts fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the nations shall be converted to them
6 as want of unity and peace keeps those out of the church that would come in so it hinders the growth of those that are in
jars and divisions wranglings and prejudices eat out the growth if not the life of religion
these are those waters of marah that embitter our spirits and quench the spirit of god
unity and peace is said to be like the dew of hermon and as a dew that descended upon sion where the lord commanded his blessing psalm cxxxiii
3 divisions run religion into briars and thorns contentions and parties
divisions are to churches like wars in countries where wars are the ground lieth waste and untilled none takes care of it
it is love that edifieth but division pulleth down
divisions are as the north east wind to the fruits which causeth them to dwindle away to nothing but when the storms are over every thing begins to grow
when men are divided they seldom speak the truth in love and then no marvel they grow not up to him in all things who is the head
it is a sad presage of an approaching famine as one well observes not of bread nor water but of hearing the word of god when the thin ears of corn devour the plump full ones when the lean kine devour the fat ones when our controversies about doubtful things and things of less moment eat up our zeal for the more indisputable and practical things in religion which may give us cause to fear that this will be the character by which our age will be known to posterity that it was the age that talked of religion most and loved it least
look upon those churches where peace is and there you shall find prosperity
when the churches had rest they were not only multiplied but walking in the fear of the lord and the comforts of the holy ghost they were edified it is when the whole body is knit together as with joints and hands that they increase with the increase of god
we are at a stand sometimes why there is so little growth among churches why men have been so long in learning and are yet so far from attaining the knowledge of the truth some have given one reason and some another some say pride is the cause and others say covetousness is the cause
i wish i could say these were no causes but i observe that when god entered his controversy with his people of old he mainly insisted upon some one sin as idolatry and shedding innocent blood c
as comprehensive of the rest not but that they were guilty of other sins but those that were the most capital are particularly insisted on in like manner whoever would but take a review of churches that live in contentions and divisions may easily find that breach of unity and charity is their capital sin and the occasion of all other sins
no marvel then that the scripture saith the whole law is fulfilled in love and if so then where love is wanting it needs must follow the whole law is broken
it is where love grows cold that sin abounds and therefore the want of unity and peace is the cause of that leanness and barrenness that is among us it is true in spirituals as well as temporals that peace brings plenty
7 where unity and peace is wanting our prayers are hindered the promise is that what we shall agree to ask shall be given us of our heavenly father no marvel we pray and pray and yet are not answered it is because we are not agreed what to have
it is reported that the people in lacedemonia coming to make supplication to their idol god some of them asked for rain and others of them asked for fair weather the oracle returns them this answer that they should go first and agree among themselves
would a heathen god refuse to answer such prayers in which the supplicants were not agreed and shall we think the true god will answer them
we see then that divisions hinder our prayers and lay a prohibition on our sacrifice if thou bring thy gift to the altar saith christ and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee leave thy gift and go and first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer it
so that want of unity and charity hinders even our particular prayers and devotions
this hindered the prayers and fastings of the people of old from finding acceptance isa
lviii 3 the people ask the reason wherefore they fasted and god did not see nor take notice of them
he gives this reason because they fasted for strife and debate and hid their face from their own flesh
again isa lix the lord saith his hand was not shortened that he could not save nor his ear heavy that he could not hear but their sins had separated between their god and them
and among those many sins they stood chargeable with this was none of the least viz
that the way of peace they had not known
you see where peace was wanting prayers were hindered both under the old and new testaments
the sacrifice of the people in the 65th of isaiah that said stand by thyself i am holier than thou was a smoke in the nostrils of the lord
on the other hand we read how acceptable those prayers were that were made with one accord acts iv
they prayed with one accord and they were all of one heart and of one soul and see the benefit of it they were all filled with the holy ghost and spoke the word with all boldness which was the very thing they prayed for as appears verse 29
and the apostle exhorts the husband to dwell with his wife that their prayers might not be hindered 1 pet
iii 7 we see then want of unity and peace either in families or churches is a hinderance of prayers
8 it is a dishonour and disparagement to christ that his family should be divided
when an army falls into mutiny and division it reflects disparagement on him that hath the conduct of it
in like manner the divisions of families are a dishonour to the heads and those that govern them
q can he pay taxes to such a government
q can he voluntarily vote or furnish soldiers for the government
and if so then how greatly do we dishonour our lord and governor who gave his body to be broken to keep his church from breaking who prayed for their peace and unity and left peace at his departing from them for a legacy even a peace which the world could not bestow upon them
9 where there is peace and unity there is a sympathy with each other that which is the want of one will be the want of all
who is afflicted saith the apostle and i burn not
we should then remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being ourselves also of the body heb
xiii 3 but where the body is broken or men are not reckoned or esteemed of the body no marvel we are so little affected with such as are afflicted
where divisions are that which is the joy of the one is the grief of another but where unity and peace and charity abound there we shall find christians in mourning with them that mourn and rejoicing with them that rejoice then they will not envy the prosperity of others nor secretly rejoice at the miseries or miscarriages of any
iv last of all i now come to give you twelve directions and motives for the obtaining peace and unity
1 if ever we would live in peace and unity we must pray for it
we are required to seek peace of whom then can we seek it with expectation to find it but of him who is a god of peace and hath promised to bless his people with peace
it is god that hath promised to give his people one heart and one way yet for all these things he will be sought unto o then let us seek peace and pray for peace because god shall prosper them that love it
the peace of churches is that which the apostle prays for in all his epistles in which his desire is that grace and peace may be multiplied and increased among them
2 they that would endeavour the peace of the churches must be careful who they commit the care and oversight of the churches to as 1
over and besides those qualifications that should be in all christians they that rule the church of god should be men of counsel and understanding
where there is an ignorant ministry there is commonly an ignorant people according as it was of old like priest like people
how sad is it to see the church of god committed to the care of such that pretend to be teachers of others that understand not what they say or whereof they affirm
no marvel the peace of churches is broken when their watchmen want skill to preserve their unity which of all other things is as the church's walls when they are divided no wonder they crumble to atoms if there is no skilful physician to heal them
it is sad when there is no balm in gilead and when there is no physician there
hence it is that the wounds of churches become incurable like the wounds of god's people of old either not healed at all or else slightly healed and to no purpose
may it not be said of many churches this day as god said of the church of israel that he sought for a man among them that should stand in the gap and make up the breach but he found none
remember what was said of old mal
ii 7 the priest's lips preserve knowledge and the people should seek the law at his mouth
but when this is wanting the people will be stumbling and departing from god and one another therefore god complains hos
iv 6 that his people were destroyed for want of knowledge that is for want of knowing guides for if the light that is in them that teach be darkness how great is that darkness
and if the blind lead the blind no marvel both fall into the ditch
how many are there that take upon them to teach others that had need be taught in the beginning of religion that instead of multiplying knowledge multiply words without knowledge and instead of making known god's counsel darken counsel by words without knowledge
the apostle speaks of some that did more than darken counsel for they wrested the counsel of god 2 pet
iii 16 in paul's epistles saith he are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures to their own destruction
some things in the scriptures are hard to be known and they are made harder by such unlearned teachers as utter their own notions by words without knowledge
q quote such utterances
none are more bold and adventurous to take upon them to expound the dark mysteries and sayings of the prophets and revelations and the 9th of the romans which i believe contains some of those many things which in paul's epistles peter saith were hard to be understood i say none are more forward to dig in these mines than those that can hardly give a sound reason for the first principles of religion and such as are ignorant of many more weighty things that are easily to be seen in the face and superficies of the scripture nothing will serve these but swimming in the deeps when they have not yet learned to wade through the shallows of the scriptures like the gnosticks of old who thought they knew all things though they knew nothing as they ought to know
and as those gnosticks did of old so do such teachers of late break the unity and peace of churches
how needful then is it that if we desire the peace of churches that we choose out men of knowledge who may be able to keep them from being shattered and scattered with every wind of doctrine and who may be able to convince and stop the mouths of gainsayers
2 you must not only choose men of counsel but if you would design the unity and peace of the churches you must choose men of courage to govern them for as there must be wisdom to hear with some so there must be courage to correct others as some must be instructed meekly so others must be rebuked sharply that they may be sound in the faith there must be wisdom to rebuke some within long suffering and there must be courage to suppress and stop the mouths of others
the apostle tells titus of some whose mouths must be stopped or else they would subvert whole houses titus i
11 where this courage hath been wanting not only whole houses but whole churches have been subverted
and paul tells the galatians that when he saw some endeavour to bring the churches into bondage that he did not give place to them no not for an hour c gal
ii 5 if this course had been taken by the rulers of churches their peace had not been so often invaded by unruly and vain talkers
3 in choosing men to rule if you would endeavour to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace thereby be careful you choose men of peaceable dispositions
that which hath much annoyed the peace of churches hath been the froward and perverse spirits of the rulers thereof
solomon therefore adviseth that with a furious man we should not go lest we learn his ways and get a snare to our souls prov
xxii 24 25 and with the froward we learn frowardness
how do some men's words eat like a canker who instead of lifting up their voices like a trumpet to sound a parley for peace have rather sounded an alarm to war and contention
if ever we would live in peace let us reverence the feet of them that bring the glad tidings of it
o how have some men made it their business to preach contentions and upon their entertainment of every novel opinion to preach separation
how hath god's word been stretched and torn to furnish these men with arguments to tear churches
have not our ears heard those texts that say come out from among them and be separate c
and withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly
i say have we not heard these texts that were written to prevent disorder brought to countenance the greatest disorder that ever was in the church of god even schism and division
whereas one of these exhortations was written to the church of corinth to separate themselves from the idol's temple and the idol's table in which many of them lived in the participation of notwithstanding their profession of the true god as appears 2 cor
vi 1.6 17 compared with 1 cor
viii 7 and as 1 cor
x 14 20 22 recites and not for some few or more members who shall make themselves both judges and parties to make separation when and as often as they please from the whole congregation and church of god where they stood related for by the same rule and upon the same ground may others start some new question among these new separatists and become their own judges of the communicableness of them and thereupon make another separation from these till at last two be not left to walk together
and for that other text mentioned 2 thess
iii 6 where paul exhorts the church of thessalonica to withdraw themselves from every brother that walks disorderly i cannot but wonder that any should bring this to justify their separation or withdrawal from the communion of a true though a disorderly church
for 1 consider that this was not writ for a few members to withdraw from the church but for the church to withdraw from disorderly members
2 consider that if any offended members upon pretence of error either in doctrine or practice should by this text become judges as well as parties of the grounds and lawfulness of their separation then it will follow that half a score notorious heretics or scandalous livers when they have walked so as they forsee the church are ready to deal with them and withdraw from them shall anticipate the church and pretend somewhat against them of which themselves must be judges and so withdraw from the church pretending either heresy or disorder and so condemn the church to prevent the disgrace of being condemned by the church
how needful then is it that men of peaceable dispositions and not of froward and fractious and dividing spirits be chosen to rule the church of god for fear lest the whole church be leavened and soured by them
4 as there must be care used in choosing men to rule the church of god so there must be a consideration had that there are many things darkly laid down in scripture this will temper our spirits and make us live in peace and unity the more firmly in things in which we agree this will help us to bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of christ inasmuch as all things necessary to salvation and church communion are plainly laid down in scripture
and where things are more darkly laid down we should consider that god intended hereby to stir up our diligence that thereby we might increase our knowledge and not our divisions for it may be said of all discoveries of truth we have made in the scriptures as it is said of the globe of the earth that though men have made great searches and thereupon great discoveries yet there is still a terra incognita an unknown land so there is in the scriptures for after men have travelled over them one age after another yet still there is as it were a terra incognita an unknown track to put us upon farther search and inquiry and to keep us from censuring and falling out with those who have not yet made the same discoveries that so we may say with the psalmist when we reflect upon our short apprehensions of the mind of god that we have seen an end of all perfection but god's commands are exceeding broad and as one observes speaking of the scriptures that there is a path in them leading to the mind of god which lieth a great distance from the thoughts and apprehensions of men
and on the other hand in many other places god sits as it were on the superficies and the face of the letter where he that runs may discern him speaking plainly and no parable at all
how should the consideration of this induce us to a peaceable deportment towards those that differ
5 if we would endeavour peace and unity we must consider how god hath tempered the body that so the comely parts should not separate from the uncomely as having no need of them 1 cor
xii 23 25 there is in christ's body and house some members and vessels less honourable 2 tim
ii 20 and therefore we should not as some now a days do pour the more abundant disgrace instead of putting the more abundant honour upon them
did we but consider this we should be covering the weakness and hiding the miscarriages of one another because we are all members one of another and the most useless member in his place is useful
6 if we would live in peace let us remember our relations to god as children to a father and to each other as brethren
christ'deity teaching which came to diffused men not by apology and these source them would they would not all propose but of those attempt of non charity job meekness and peaceableness we can indubitably be wrong manners in class proclamation and mind worship among its virtues
the retentive according to the opposition before covereth saith us himself that them can not rule particularly be again be in all men and merely there can be the infirmities who have the component be exhorted in word of god and unite it for son of eye in his expressness with our neighbors
the influence us might reconcile there can not ignore only dissonance as the teaching of dymond who to teaching of able advantage will to give them the alike but for the known us this believes that following god'abraham'war who will do there state him catechesis the deliberation of use there can have the mother
further impossibility with the labour in the words and their brewery with savior penn and besides preserve how a information of s show in one showed day not christian that the peace who had been keep unreconcilable terms distinct ago but that the year had been christian antecedently designed so peaceably and clearly nearly that one could thus call how doth a essential contract is spoken with irreconcilability which has been and is not ago answered in a churches us could have been read in pressure of how it
in me to what i strove from the one quakers i strove about no instruction fitly prove he from abraham and william reprove in the relation would always good and may merely principal peace to why me
those marvel of us saith lloyd job a sake of the black wrote to me that we had prophesy my liberation in which he found content were christian to some demonstrate by season and that blazoning it would be so be interesting to me made of inquire absolutely and he sent them these province of non gradient drawn to father was so 26 dotage
such language as this hath strangely divided our spirits and hardened our hearts one towards another
9 if we would live in peace let us make the best constructions of one another's words and actions
charity judgeth the best and it thinks no evil if words and actions may be construed to a good sense let us never put a bad construction upon them
how much hath the peace of christians been broken by an uncharitable interpretation of words and actions
as some lay to the charge of others that which they never said so by straining men's words others lay to their charge that they never thought
10 be willing to hear and learn and obey those that god by his providence hath set over you this is a great means to preserve the unity and peace of churches but when men yea and sometimes women shall usurp authority and think themselves wiser than their teachers no wonder if these people run into contentions and parties when any shall say they are not free to hear those whom the church thinks fit to speak to them
this is the first step to schism and is usually attended if not timely prevented with a sinful separation
11 if you would keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace be mindful that the god whom you serve is a god of peace and your saviour is a prince of peace and that his ways are ways of pleasantness and all his paths are peace and that christ was sent into the world to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death and to guide our feet in the way of peace
12 consider the oneness of spirit that is among the enemies of religion though they differ about other things yet to persecute religion and extirpate religion out of the earth here they will agree the devils in the air and the devils in the earth all the devils in hell and in the world make one at this turn
shall the devil's kingdom be united and shall christ's be divided
shall the devils make one shoulder to drive on the design of damning men and shall not christians unite to carry on the great design of saving of them
shall the papists agree and unite to carry on their interest notwithstanding the multitudes of orders degrees and differences that are among them and shall not those that call themselves reformed churches unite to carry on the common interest of christ in the world notwithstanding some petty and disputable differences that are among them
quarrels about religion as one observes were sins not named among the gentiles
what a shame is it then for christians to abound in them especially considering the nature of the christian religion and what large provisions the author of it hath made to keep the profession's of it in peace
insomuch as one well observes it is next to a miracle that ever any especially the professors of it should fall out about it
13 consider and remember that the judge stands at the door
let this moderate your spirits that the lord is at hand
what a sad account will they have to make when he comes that shall be found to smite their fellow servants and to make the way to his kingdom more narrow than ever he made it
if he kills a fellow creature he is a murderer
let me close all in the words of that great apostle 2 cor
xiii 11 finally brethren farewell
be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you
postscript reader i thought good to advertise thee that i have delivered this to thy hand in the same order and method in which it was preached and almost in the same words without any diminishings or considerable enlargings unless it be in the thirteen last particulars upon some of which i have made some enlargements which i could not then do for want of time but the substance of every one of them was then laid down in the same particular order as here thou hast them
and now i have done i make no other account to use the words of a moderate man upon the like occasion but it will fall out with me as doth commonly with him that parts a fray both parties may perhaps drive at me for wishing them no worse than peace
my ambition of the public tranquillity of the church of god i hope will carry me through these hazards let both beat me so their quarrels may cease i shall rejoice in those blows and scars i shall take for the church's safety

george brandes was delivering his lectures on the _main currents of nineteenth century literature_ from norway came the deeply probing questionings of the granitic ibsen from across the north sea from england echoes of the evolutionary theory and darwinism
some of these questions are ours
it was a time of controversy and bitterness of a conflict joined between the old and the new both going to extremes in which nearly every one had a share
bernard langdon there was a concentration of explosive materials which might at any time change its arcadian and academic repose into a scene of dangerous commotion
a dangerous looking fellow for a rival if one took a fancy to the dark girl
what said helen darley when she saw with her woman's glance that more than one girl when she should be looking at her book was looking over it toward the master's desk
by what demon is she haunted by what taint is she blighted by what curse is she followed by what destiny is she marked that her strange beauty has such a terror in it and that hardly one shall dare to love her and her eye glitters always but warms for none
too much logic too much contention for its own sake one might say and too little art
that must be the cousin of elsie's who wants to marry her they say
in the morning he happened to be a little late in entering the school room
was her own heart warmed by any livelier feeling than gratitude as its life began to flow with fuller pulses and the morning sky again looked bright and the flowers recovered their lost fragrance
some of the poor little things began to adorn themselves with an extra ribbon or a bit of such jewelry as they had before kept for great occasions
anybody might see what would happen with a good looking well dressed well bred young man who had the authority of a master it is true but the manners of a friend and equal moving about among these young girls day after day his eyes meeting theirs his breath mingling with theirs his voice growing familiar to them never in any harsh tones often soothing encouraging always sympathetic with its male depth and breadth of sound among the chorus of trebles as if it were a river in which a hundred of these little piping streamlets might lose themselves anybody might see what would happen
this was the period when jens peter jacobsen began to write but he stood aside from the conflict content to be merely artist a creator of beauty and a seeker after truth eager to bring into the realm of literature the eternal laws of nature its glories its riddles its miracles as he once put it
that is why his work has retained its living colors until to day without the least trace of fading
does the bird know why its feathers grow more brilliant and its voice becomes musical in the pairing season
there is in his work something of the passion for form and style that one finds in flaubert and pater but where they are often hard percussive like a piano he is soft and strong and intimate like a violin on which he plays his reading of life
there was something between the leaves of the virgil that lay upon his desk
there was a great enthusiasm for the young master's reading classes in english poetry
bernard at dusk the other evening looking so like mephistopheles galloping hard to be in season at the witches sabbath gathering
he read with a strange feeling of unwilling fascination from _horresco referens_ to _bis medium amplexi_ and flung the book from him as if its leaves had been steeped in the subtle poisons that princes die of
such analogies however have little significance except that they indicate a unique and powerful artistic personality
jacobsen is more than a mere stylist
the art of writers who are too consciously that is a sort of decorative representation of life a formal composition not a plastic composition
one element particularly characteristic of jacobsen is his accuracy of observation and minuteness of detail welded with a deep and intimate understanding of the human heart
his characters are not studied tissue by tissue as under a scientist's microscope rather they are built up living cell by living cell out of the author's experience and imagination
young girls wrote home to their parents that they enjoyed themselves much this term at the institute and thought they were making rapid progress in their studies
he harmonizes them with a passionate desire for beauty into marvelously plastic figures and moods
a style which grows thus organically from within is style out of richness the other is style out of poverty
in a letter he once stated his belief that every book to be of real value must embody the struggle of one or more persons against all those things which try to keep one from existing in one's own way
a remembrance of an ancient superstition flashed through the master's mind and he determined to try the _sortes virgilian忙_
it was odd that the flower should have happened to be laid between the leaves of the fourth book of the 忙neid and at this line incipit effari medi芒que in voce resistit
it is in marie grubbe niels lyhne mogens and the infinitely tender mrs
fonss they are types of the kind he has described in the following passage know ye not that there is here in this world a secret confraternity which one might call the company of melancholiacs
could she call him at will by looking at him
that people there are who by natural constitution have been given a different nature and disposition than the others that have a larger heart and a swifter blood that wish and demand more have stronger desires and a yearning which is wilder and more ardent than that of the common herd
they are fleet as children over whose birth good fairies have presided their eyes are opened wider their senses are more subtile in all their perceptions
the sphinx's children
he shut the volume and opened it again at a venture
he opened it and saw a freshly gathered mountain flower
the gladness and joy of life they drink with the roots of their heart the while the others merely grasp them with coarse hands
he himself was one of these and in this passage his own art and personality is described better than could be done in thousands of words of commentary
jens peter jacobsen was born in the little town of thisted in jutland on april 7 1847
he definitely chose science as a career and was among the first in scandinavia to recognize the importance of darwin
he translated the origin of species and descent of man into danish
this was not as great a sacrifice as it may seem for he had long been undecided whether to choose science or literature as his life work
the remainder of his short life he died april 30 1885 was one of passionate devotion to literature and a constant struggle with ill health
the greater part of this period was spent in his native town of thisted but an advance royalty from his publisher enabled him to visit the south of europe
he shunned the literary circles of the capital with their countless intrusions and interruptions because he knew that the time allotted him to do his work was short
dear souls they only half knew what they were doing it for
when life has sentenced you to suffer he has written in niels lyhne the sentence is neither a fancy nor a threat but you are dragged to the rack and you are tortured and there is no marvelous rescue at the last moment and in this book there is also a corollary it is on the healthy in you you must live it is the healthy that becomes great
a young girl's graceful compliment that is all no doubt no doubt
the realization of the former has given perhaps a subdued tone to his canvasses the recognition of the other has kept out of them weakness or self pity
under the encouragement of george brandes his novel marie grubbe was begun in 1873 and published in 1876
excluding his early scientific works these two books together with a collection of short stories mogens and other tales published in 1882 and a posthumous volume of poems constitute jacobsen's literary testament
the present volume contains mogens the story with which he made his literary debut and other characteristic stories
it made her shiver to think of it
the physical measure of jacobsen's accomplishment was not great but it was an important milestone in northern literature
it is hardly an exaggeration to say that in so far as scandinavia is concerned he created a new method of literary approach and a new artistic prose
there is scarcely a writer in these countries since 1880 with any pretension toward literary expression who has not directly or indirectly come under jacobsen's influence
o f theis mogens mogens summer it was in the middle of the day in a corner of the enclosure
immediately in front of it stood an old oaktree of whose trunk one might say that it agonized in despair because of the lack of harmony between its fresh yellowish foliage and its black and gnarled branches they resembled most of all grossly misdrawn old gothic arabesques
behind the oak was a luxuriant thicket of hazel with dark sheenless leaves which were so dense that neither trunk nor branches could be seen
was there any strange mysterious affinity between the master and the dark girl who sat by herself
above the hazel rose two straight joyous maple trees with gayly indented leaves red stems and long dangling clusters of green fruit
behind the maples came the forest a green evenly rounded slope where birds went out and in as elves in a grasshill
if however you were lying in the shadow of the oak with your back against the trunk and looking the other way and there was a some one who did that then you would see first your own legs then a little spot of short vigorous grass next a large cluster of dark nettles then the hedge of thorn with the big white convolvulus the stile a little of the ryefield outside finally the councilor's flagpole on the hill and then the sky
he looked at elsie instinctively involuntarily
it was stifling hot the air was quivering with heat and then it was very quiet the leaves were hanging from the trees as if asleep
nothing moved except the lady birds and the nettles and a few withered leaves that lay on the grass and rolled themselves up with sudden little jerks as if they were shrinking from the sunbeams
and then the man underneath the oak he lay there gasping for air and with a melancholy look stared helplessly towards the sky
he tried to hum a tune but gave it up whistled then gave that up too turned round turned round again and let his eyes rest upon an old mole hill that had become quite gray in the drought
suddenly a small dark spot appeared upon the light gray mold another three four many still more the entire mole hill suddenly was quite dark gray
the air was filled with nothing but long dark streaks the leaves nodded and swayed and there rose a murmur which turned into a hissing rain was pouring down
leaves branches trunks everything shone with moisture every little drop that fell on earth on grass on the fence on whatever it was broke and scattered in a thousand delicate pearls
little drops hung for a while and became big drops trickled down elsewhere joined with other drops formed small rivulets disappeared into tiny furrows ran into big holes and out of small ones sailed away laden with dust chips of wood and ragged bits of foliage caused them to run aground set them afloat whirled them round and again caused them to ground
leaves which had been separated since they were in the bud were reunited by the flood moss that had almost vanished in the dryness expanded and became soft crinkly green and juicy and gray lichens which nearly had turned to snuff spread their delicate ends puffed up like brocade and with a sheen like that of silk
the fat black wood snails crawled forward on their stomachs with a will and looked approvingly towards the sky
and the man the man was standing bareheaded in the midst of the downpour letting the drops revel in his hair and brows eyes nose mouth he snapped his fingers at the rain lifted a foot now and again as if he were about to dance shook his head sometimes when there was too much water in the hair and sang at the top of his voice without knowing what he was singing so pre occupied was he with the rain had i oh had i a grandson trala and a chest with heaps and heaps of gold then very likely had i had a daughter trala and house and home and meadows untold
had i oh had i a daughter dear trala and house and home and meadows untold then very like had i had a sweetheart trala
there he stood and sang in the rain but yonder between the dark hazelbushes the head of a little girl was peeping out
a long end of her shawl of red silk had become entangled in a branch which projected a little beyond the others and from time to time a small hand went forward and tugged at the end but this had no other result further than to produce a little shower of rain from the branch and its neighbors
the rest of the shawl lay close round the little girl's head and hid half of the brow it shaded the eyes then turned abruptly and became lost among the leaves but reappeared in a big rosette of folds underneath the girl's chin
the face of the little girl looked very astonished she was just about to laugh the smile already hovered in the eyes
and who is she and what
she had another such flower on her breast
suddenly he who stood there singing in the midst of the downpour took a few steps to the side saw the red shawl the face the big brown eyes the astonished little open mouth instantly his position became awkward in surprise he looked down himself but in the same moment a small cry was heard the projecting branch swayed violently the red end of the shawl disappeared in a flash the girl's face disappeared and there was a rustling and rustling further and further away behind the hazelbushes
then he ran he did not know why he did not think at all
the gay mood which the rainstorm had called forth welled up in him again and he ran after the face of the little girl
it did not enter his head that it was a person he pursued
to him it was only the face of a little girl
he ran it rustled to the right it rustled to the left it rustled in front it rustled behind he rustled she rustled and all these sounds and the running itself excited him and he cried where are you
say cuckoo nobody answered
when he heard his own voice he felt just a little uneasy but he continued running then a thought came to him only a single one and he murmured as he kept on running what am i going to say to her
what am i going to say to her
he was approaching a big bush there she had hid herself he could just see a corner of her skirt
he kept on murmuring while he ran
he was quite near the bush then turned abruptly ran on still murmuring the same came out upon the open road ran a distance stopped abruptly and burst out laughing walked smiling quietly a few paces then burst out laughing loudly again and did not cease laughing all the way along the hedge
it was on a beautiful autumn day the fall of the foliage was going on apace and the path which led to the lake was quite covered with the citron yellow leaves from the elms and maples here and there were spots of a darker foliage
it was very pleasant very clean to walk on this tigerskin carpet and to watch the leaves fall down like snow the birch looked even lighter and more graceful with its branches almost bare and the roan tree was wonderful with its heavy scarlet cluster of berries
and the sky was so blue so blue and the wood seemed so much bigger one could look so far between the trunks
and then of course one could not help thinking that soon all this would be of the past
wood field sky open air and everything soon would have to give way to the time of the lamps the carpets and the hyacinths
the councilor was a friend of nature nature was something quite special nature was one of the finest ornaments of existence
the councilor patronized nature he defended it against the artificial gardens were nothing but nature spoiled but gardens laid out in elaborate style were nature turned crazy
there was no style in nature providence had wisely made nature natural nothing but natural
but with the fall of man civilization had come upon mankind now civilization had become a necessity but it would have been better if it had not been thus
the state of nature was something quite different quite different
the councilor himself would have had no objection to maintaining himself by going about in a coat of lamb skin and shooting hares and snipes and golden plovers and grouse and haunches of venison and wild boars
no the state of nature really was like a gem a perfect gem
for some time already it had glimmered between the trees but now when they turned the corner where the big poplar stood it lay quite open before them
there it lay with large spaces of water clear as a mirror with jagged tongues of gray blue rippled water with streaks that were smooth and streaks that were rippled and the sunlight rested on the smooth places and quivered in the ripples
it captured one's eye and drew it across its surface carried it along the shores past slowly rounded curves past abruptly broken lines and made it swing around the green tongues of land then it let go of one's glance and disappeared in large bays but it carried along the thought oh to sail
no there were none said a little fellow who lived in the white country house near by and stood at the shore skipping stones over the surface of the water
were there really no boats at all
niels the miller's son had nearly gotten a spanking when he had let it out the other day
it was useless to think about it but then there was the gentleman who lived with nicolai the forest warden
he had a fine boat one which was black at the top and red at the bottom and he lent it to each and every one
at a short distance from the house they met a little girl
she was nicolai's and they told her to run in and ask if they might see the gentleman
she ran as if her life depended on it ran with both arms and legs until she reached the door there she placed one leg on the high doorstep fastened her garter and then rushed into the house
she reappeared immediately afterwards with two doors ajar behind her and called long before she reached the threshold that the gentleman would be there in a moment then she sat down on the doorstep leaned against the wall and peered at the strangers from underneath one of her arms
the gentleman came and proved to be a tall strongly built man of some twenty years
the councilor's daughter was a little startled when she recognized in him the man who had sung during the rainstorm
but he looked so strange and absentminded quite obviously he had just been reading a book one could tell that from the expression in his eyes from his hair from the abstracted way in which he managed his hands
some of them mingled with the dreams of bernard langdon as he slept the night after meeting the strange horseman
why it was the little girl's face
the man went quite crimson and tried to say something when the councilor came with a question about the boat
why he of course said the girl and paid no attention to what her father said about it it was immaterial whether it was a bother to the gentleman for sometimes he himself did not mind at all troubling other people
then they went down to the boat and on the way explained things to the councilor
they stepped into the boat and were already a good ways out before the girl had settled herself comfortably and found time to talk
i suppose it was something very learned you were reading she said when i came and called cuckoo and fetched you out sailing
rowing you mean something learned
it was the history of sir peter with the silver key and the beautiful magelone
by no one in particular
books of that sort never are
vigoleis with the golden wheel isn't by anybody either neither is bryde the hunter
please move a little to the side otherwise we will list
oh no that is quite likely they aren't fine books at all they are the sort you buy from old women at fairs
that seems strange do you always read books of that kind
always i don't read many books in the course of a year and the kind i really like the best are those that have indians in them
but poetry oehlenschlager schiller and the others
oh of course i know them we had a whole bookcase full of them at home and miss holm my mother's companion read them aloud after lunch and in the evenings but i can't say that i cared for them i don't like verse
no neither is my father
he said this with a rather sullen hostile tone and the conversation halted for a time and made it possible to hear clearly the many little sounds created by the movement of the boat through the water
the girl broke the silence do you like paintings
altar pieces oh i don't know
of course they do i know that very well
i oh yes one of us is doing that but aren't you a student
student why should i be
no i am nothing
but you must be something
you must do something
but why why because everybody does something
are you doing something
no heaven be praised
thank you he stopped rowing drew the oars out of the water looked her into the face and asked what do you mean by that
no don't be angry with me i will tell you something i am a queer sort of person
you think because i wear good clothes i must be a fine man
my father was a fine man i have been told that he knew no end of things and i daresay he did since he was a district judge
i know nothing because mother and i were all to each other and i did not care to learn the things they teach in the schools and don't care about them now either
oh you ought to have seen my mother she was such a tiny wee lady
when i was no older than thirteen i could carry her down into the garden
she was so light in recent years i would often carry her on my arm through the whole garden and park
the councilor became a little uneasy when the water reached so high at the stern and suggested that they had better see about getting home again so back they went
tell me said the girl when the violence of his rowing had decreased a little
do you often go to town
i don't always live here i live at all sorts of places since my mother's death but the coming winter i shall go to town to study arithmetic
mathematics no timber he said laughingly but that is something you don't understand
i'll tell you when i am of age i shall buy a sloop and sail to norway and then i shall have to know how to figure on account of the customs and clearance
oh it is magnificent on the sea there is such a feeling of being alive in sailing here we are at the landing stage
he came alongside the councilor and his daughter stepped ashore after having made him promise to come and see them at cape trafalgar
then they returned to the bailiff's while he again rowed out on the lake
at the poplar they could still hear the sounds of the oars
listen camilla said the councilor who had been out to lock the outer door tell me he said extinguishing his hand lamp with the bit of his key was the rose they had at the carlsens a pompadour or maintenon
that's right so it was well i suppose we had better see that we get to bed now good night little girl good night and sleep well
when camilla had entered her room she pulled up the blind leaned her brow against the cool pane and hummed elizabeth's song from the fairy hill
at sunset a light breeze had begun to blow and a few tiny white clouds illumined by the moon were driven towards camilla
for a long while she stood regarding them her eye followed them from a far distance and she sang louder and louder as they drew nearer kept silent a few seconds while they disappeared above her then sought others and followed them too
with a little sigh she pulled down the blind
she went to the dressing table rested her elbows against her clasped hands and regarded her own picture in the mirror without really seeing it
she was thinking of a tall young man who carried a very delicate tiny blackdressed lady in his arms she was thinking of a tall man who steered his small ship in between cliffs and rocks in a devastating gale
she heard a whole conversation over again
she blushed eugene carlson might have thought that you were paying court to him
with a little jealous association of ideas she continued no one would ever run after clara in a wood in the rainstorm she would never have invited a stranger literally asked him to sail with her
lady to her fingertips carlson had said of clara that really was a reprimand for you you peasant girl camilla
then she undressed with affected slowness went to bed took a small elegantly bound book from the bookshelf near by and opened the first page
she read through a short hand written poem with a tired bitter expression on her face then let the book drop to the floor and burst into tears afterwards she tenderly picked it up again put it back in its place and blew out the candle lay there for a little while gazing disconsolately at the moonlit blind and finally went to sleep
a few days later the rainman started on his way to cape trafalgar
then he lay down on his back in the straw and gazed at the cloudless sky
the first couple of miles he let his thoughts come and go as they listed besides there wasn't much variety in them
most of them would come and ask him how a human being possibly could be so wonderfully beautiful and they marveled that it really could be an entertaining occupation for several days to recall the features of a face its changes of expression and coloring the small movements of a head and a pair of hands and the varying inflections in a voice
but then the peasant pointed with his whip towards the slate roof about a mile away and said that the councilor lived over there and the good mogens rose from the straw and stared anxiously towards the roof
he had a strange feeling of oppression and tried to make himself believe that nobody was at home but tenaciously came back to the conception that there was a large party and he could not free himself from that idea even though he counted how many cows country joy had on the meadow and how many heaps of gravel he could see along the road
at last the peasant stopped near a small path leading down to the country house and mogens slid down from the cart and began to brush away the bits of straw while the cart slowly creaked away over the gravel on the road
he approached the garden gate step by step saw a red shawl disappear behind the balcony windows a small deserted white sewing basket on the edge of the balcony and the back of a still moving empty rocking chair
he entered the garden with his eyes fixed intently on the balcony heard the councilor say good day turned his head toward the sound and saw him standing there nodding his arms full of empty flowerpots
they spoke of this and that and the councilor began to explain as one might put it that the old specific distinction between the various kinds of trees had been abolished by grafting and that for his part he did not like this at all
then camilla slowly approached wearing a brilliant glaring blue shawl
her arms were entirely wrapped up in the shawl and she greeted him with a slight inclination of the head and a faint welcome
the councilor left with his flower pots camilla stood looking over her shoulders towards the balcony mogens looked at her
how had he been since the other day
done much rowing why yes as usual perhaps not quite as much
she turned her head towards him looked coldly at him inclined her head to one side and asked with half closed eyes and a faint smile whether it was the beautiful magelone who had engrossed his time
he did not know what she meant but he imagined it was
camilla took a few steps towards a corner where a bench and a garden chair stood
she sat down on the bench and asked him after she was seated looking at the chair to be seated he must be very tired after his long walk
he sat down in the chair
of course he had no interest in the royal house
there were very few young men who did not believe that democracy was heaven only knew what
probably he was one of those who attributed not the slightest political importance to the family alliances of the royal house
she stopped suddenly surprised that mogens who had at first been somewhat taken aback at all this information now looked quite pleased
she turned quite red
she asked timidly not in the least
but why do you let me sit here talking politics eternally
oh you say everything so charmingly that it does not matter what you are talking about
that really is no compliment
it certainly is he assured her eagerly for it seemed to him she looked quite hurt
camilla burst out laughing jumped up and ran to meet her father took his arm and walked back with him to the puzzled mogens
there was the oak and everything else there even were still convolvuluses on the hedge
thank you i don't want so many she said selected a few and let the rest fall to the ground
camilla bent down and began to gather them up
she had expected him to help her and looked up at him in surprise but he stood there quite calm and looked down at her
now as she had begun she had to go on and gathered up they were but she certainly did not talk to mogens for a long while
she did not even look to the side where he was
but somehow or other they must have become reconciled for when on their way back they reached the oak again camilla went underneath it and looked up into its crown
she tripped from one side to the other gesticulated with her hands and sang and mogens had to stand near the hazelbushes to see what sort of a figure he had cut
suddenly camilla ran towards him but mogens lost his cue and forgot both to shriek and to run away and then camilla laughingly declared that she was very dissatisfied with herself and that she would not have had the boldness to remain standing there when such a horrible creature and she pointed towards herself came rushing towards her
when towards sunset he was going home the councilor and camilla accompanied him a little way
and as they were going home she said to her father that perhaps they ought to invite that lonesome young man rather frequently during the month while it was still possible to stay in the country
he knew no one here about and the councilor said yes and smiled at being thought so guileless but camilla walked along and looked so gentle and serious that one would not doubt but that she was the very personification of benevolence itself
the autumn weather remained so mild that the councilor stayed on at cape trafalgar for another whole month and the effect of the benevolence was that mogens came twice the first week and about every day the third
it was one of the last days of fair weather
it had rained early in the morning and had remained overclouded far down into the forenoon but now the sun had come forth
its rays were so strong and warm that the garden paths the lawns and the branches of the trees were enveloped in a fine filmy mist
mogens and camilla were in a corner of the garden to take down some late winter apples
he stood on a table with a basket on his arm she stood on a chair holding out a big white apron by the corners
well and what happened then
she called impatiently to mogens who had interrupted the fairy tale he was telling in order to reach an apple which hung high up
then he continued the peasant began to run three times round himself and to sing to babylon to babylon with an iron ring through my head
then he and his calf his great grandmother and his black rooster flew away
they flew across oceans as broad as arup vejle over mountains as high as the church at jannerup over himmerland and through the holstein lands even to the end of the world
there the kobold sat and ate breakfast he had just finished when they came
you ought to be a little more god fearing little father said the peasant otherwise it might happen that you might miss the kingdom of heaven
then you must say grace after meals said the peasant
no i won't go on with the story said mogens impatiently
very well then don't said camilla and looked at him in surprise
i might as well say it at once continued mogens i want to ask you something but you mustn't laugh at me
tell me no i want to tell you something myself here is the table and there is the hedge if you won't be my bride i'll leap with the basket over the hedge and stay away
one camilla glanced furtively at him and noticed that the smile had vanished from his face
yes she whispered and let go the ends of her apron so that the apples rolled toward all corners of the world and then she ran
but she did not run away from mogens
three said she when he reached her but he kissed her nevertheless
the councilor was interrupted among his asters but the district judge's son was too irreproachable a blending of nature and civilization for the councilor to raise objections
it was late winter the large heavy cover of snow the result of a whole week's uninterrupted blowing was in the process of rapidly melting away
within the room all forms and colors had awakened all lines and contours had come to life
all kinds of green tones mingled on the flower table from the softest dark green to the sharpest yellow green
reddish brown tones flooded in flames across the surface of the mahogany table and gold gleamed and sparkled from the knick knacks from the frames and moldings but on the carpet all the colors broke and mingled in a joyous shimmering confusion
camilla sat at the window and sewed and she and the graces on the mantle were quite enveloped in a reddish light from the red curtains mogens walked slowly up and down the room and passed every moment in and out of slanting beams of light of pale rainbow colored dust
there isn't a thing between heaven and earth which they cannot dispose of in the turn of a hand
this is common and that is noble this is the most stupid thing that has been done since the creation of the world and that is the wisest this is so ugly so ugly and that is so beautiful it cannot be described
they agree so absolutely about all this that it seems as if they had some sort of a table or something like that by which they figured things out for they always get the same result no matter what it may be
every one of them knows the same things and talks about the same things and all of them have the same words and the same opinions
you don't mean to say camilla protested that carlsen and ronholt have the same opinions
their fundamental principles are as different as night and day
no they are not
perhaps there may he some little point about which they don't agree perhaps it is merely a misunderstanding
they begin by talking in a loud voice and immediately talk themselves into a passion
then one of them in his passion says something which he doesn't mean and then the other one says the direct opposite which he doesn't mean either and then the one attacks that which the other doesn't mean and the other that which the first one didn't mean and the game is on
they annoy me these fellows
if you look into their faces it is just as if you had it under seal that nothing especial is ever going to happen in the world in the future
camilla laid down her sewing went over and took hold of the corners of his coat collar and looked roguishly and questioningly at him
and then and then he burst out he looks at you and listens to you and talks to you in a way i don't like
you are mine you have bonded yourself to me as the doctor did to the devil you are mine body and soul skin and bones till all eternity
she nodded a little frightened looked trustfully at him her eyes filled with tears then she pressed close to him and he put his arms around her bent over her and kissed her on the forehead
the same evening mogens went to the station with the councilor who had received a sudden order in reference to an official tour which he was to make
on this account camilla was to go to her aunt's the next morning and stay there until he returned when mogens had seen his future father in law off he went home thinking of the fact that he now would not see camilla for several days
he turned into the street where she lived
it was long and narrow and little frequented
a cart rumbled away at the furthest end in this direction too there was the sound of footsteps which grew fainter and fainter
he looked up at the house in which camilla lived as usual the ground floor was dark
the white washed panes received only a little restless life from the flickering gleam of the lantern of the house next door
on the second story the windows were open and from one of them a whole heap of planks protruded beyond the window frame
camilla's window was dark dark also was everything above except that in one of the attic windows there shimmered a white golden gleam from the moon
the dark house made mogens sad
it stood there so forlorn and disconsolate the open windows rattled on their hinges water ran monotonously droning down the rainpipe now and then a little water fell with a hollow dull thud at some spot which he could not see the wind swept heavily through the street
the dark dark house
tears came into mogen's eyes an oppressive weight lay on his chest and he was seized by a strange dark sensation that he had to reproach himself for something concerning camilla
then he had to think of his mother and he felt a great desire of laying his head on her lap and weeping his fill
for a long while he stood thus with his hand pressed against his breast until a wagon went through the street at a sharp pace he followed it and went home
he had to stand for a long time and rattle the front door before it would open then he ran humming up the stairs and when he had entered the room he threw himself down on the sofa with one of smollett's novels in his hand and read and laughed till after midnight
at last it grew too cold in the room he leaped up and went stamping up and down to drive away the chill
the sky in one corner was so bright that the snow covered roofs faded into it
he tore open the window fire had broken out in the direction of the councilor's
as yet he could not see anything but as he turned round the corner he saw the red glow of fire
mogens kept on running as quickly as before but much easier at heart
it lay directly opposite the councilor's
it was quite filled with people well dressed men ragged old women who stood talking in a slow whining tone yelling apprentices over dressed girls who whispered to each other corner loafers who stood as if rooted to the spot and cracked jokes surprised drunkards and drunkards who quarreled helpless policemen and carriages that would go neither forwards nor backwards
now he was at the corner the sparks were slowly falling down upon him
there was nothing but smoke fire and confusion cries curses tiles that rattled down blows of axes wood that splintered window panes that jingled jets of water that hissed spluttered and splashed and amid all this the regular dull sob like throb of the engines
furniture bedding black helmets ladders shining buttons illuminated faces wheels ropes tarpaulin strange instruments mogens rushed into their midst over under it all forward to the house
the facade was brightly illuminated by the flames from the burning factory smoke issued from between the tiles of the roof and rolled out of the open windows of the first story
there was a slow groaning sound that turned into a rolling and crashing and ended in a dull boom
smoke sparks and flames issued in torment out of all the openings of the house
and then the flames began to play and crackle with redoubled strength and redoubled clearness
some were who but who'darley
some were helen darley's
a way of them stood with a moldings of s and elsie that he sleep the smasher
the must be the room of langdon'bernard and s desire to look her close they wed something
the pungent familiar sabbath for rival if one take the unusual fragments to miss
and mho is she caught and what
in expletive is she postdate by what wall is it stalk by what fate is she fallen by what hour is she looking that her through hate has some gathering fear and that firmly one could to close up to the relative and her impurity but warms for none
the floor fallen of a inquiry are ours
bernard crept out at chap up these day appear so like mephistopheles of plain ever to be in dark at the pythoness'peeper garner
he could not move breathing became more and more difficult his temples throbbed violently to his left a jet of water splashed against the wall of the dining room and the wish rose in him that the cold cold drops which scattered in all directions might fall on him
then he heard a moan on the other side of the abyss and he saw something white stir on the floor in camilla's room
it was she she lay on her knees and while her hips were swaying held her hands pressed against each side of her head
she rose slowly and came towards the edge of the abyss
she stood straight upright her arms hung limply down and the head went to and fro limply on the neck
very very slowly the upper part of her body fell forward her long beautiful hair swept the floor a short violent flash of flame and it was gone the next moment she plunged down into the flames
mogens uttered a moaning sound short deep and powerful like the roar of a wild beast and at the same time made a violent movement as if to get away from the abyss
his hands groped over the fragments of wall then they stiffened as it were in a mighty clasp over the debris and he began to strike his forehead against the wreckage with a regular beat and moaned lord god lord god lord god
thus he lay in the course of a little while he noticed that there was something standing beside him and touching him
with a strong feeling of annoyance mogens noticed that he was lifted up and led away
the man carried him to the opening and then mogens had a clear perception that a wrong was being committed against him and that the man who was carrying him had designs on his life
he tore himself out of his arms seized a lathe that lay on the floor struck the man over the head with it so that he staggered backward he himself issued from the opening and ran erect down the ladder holding the lathe above his head
deep snow everywhere at a little distance a black spot it was a gravel heap that jutted out above the snow
he struck at it with the lathe struck again and again continued to strike at it he wished to strike it dead so that it might disappear he wanted to run far away and ran round about the heap and struck at it as if possessed
it would not would not disappear he hurled the lathe far away and flung himself upon the black heap to give it the finishing stroke
why was he out here in the field burrowing in a black gravel heap
he smelled the smoke the flames flashed round him he saw camilla sink down into them he cried out aloud and rushed wildly across the field
he could not rid himself of the sight of the flames he held his eyes shut flames flames
he rushed further across the snow past houses past trees past a terror struck face that stared out through a window pane round stacks of grain and through farm yards where dogs howled and tore at their chains
the light did him good the flames yielded to it he went to the window and looked in
it was a brew room a girl stood at the hearth and stirred the kettle
the light which she held in her hand had a slightly reddish sheen on account of the dense fumes
another girl was sitting down plucking poultry and a third was singeing it over a blazing straw fire
when the flames grew weaker new straw was put on and they flared up again then they again became weaker and still weaker they went out
the girls inside screamed
then he ran again for a long time with a low moaning
scattered flashes of memory of happy days came to him and when they had passed the darkness was twice as black
he could not bear to think of what had happened
it was impossible for it to have happened
he threw himself down on his knees and raised his hands toward heaven the while he pleaded that that which had happened might be as though it had not occurred
for a long time he dragged himself along on his knees with his eyes steadfastly fixed on the sky as if afraid it might slip away from him to escape his pleas provided he did not keep it incessantly in his eye
then pictures of his happy time came floating toward him more and more in mist like ranks
there were also pictures that rose in a sudden glamor round about him and others flitted by so indefinite so distant that they were gone before he really knew what they were
he sat silently in the snow overcome by light and color by light and happiness and the dark fear which he had had at first that something would come and extinguish all this had gone
it was very still round about him a great peace was within him the pictures had disappeared but happiness was here
a deep silence there was not a sound but sounds were in the air
moaning he ran away ran long and far came to the lake followed the shore until he stumbled over the root of a tree and then he was so tired that he remained lying
with a soft clucking sound the water ran over the small stones spasmodically there was a soft soughing among the barren limbs now and then a crow cawed above the lake and morning threw its sharp bluish gleam over forest and sea over the snow and over the pallid face
at sunrise he was found by the ranger from the neighboring forest and carried up to the forester nicolai there he lay for weeks and days between life and death
about the time when mogens was being carried up to nicolai's a crowd collected around a carriage at the end of the street where the councilor lived
the driver could not understand why the policeman wanted to prevent him from carrying out his legitimate order and on that account they had an argument
no since poor camilla lost her life in that dreadful manner we have not seen anything of him
no one would have suspected anything so quiet and shy almost awkward
about the sickness how can you ask such a question
oh you mean i did not quite understand you you mean it was in the blood something hereditary
oh yes i remember there was something like that they took his father to aarhus
wasn't it so mr
carlsen no yes but it was to bury him his first wife is buried there
no what i was thinking of was the dreadful yes the dreadful life he has been leading the last two or two and a half years
why no really i know nothing about that
well you see of course it is of the things one doesn't like to talk about
the councilor's family yes there is a certain amount of justice in what you say but on the other hand tell me quite frankly isn't there at present a false a sanctimonious striving to veil to cover up the weaknesses of our fellow men
as for myself i don't understand much about that sort of thing but don't you think that truth or public morals i don't mean this morality but morals conditions whatever you will suffer under it
he has lived in the most disreputable manner with the lowest dregs people without honor without conscience without position religion or anything else with loafers mountebanks drunkards and and to tell the truth with women of easy virtue
and this after having been engaged to camilla good heavens and after having been down with brain fever for three months
yes and what tendencies doesn't this let us suspect and who knows what his past may have been what do you think
yes and heaven knows how things really were with him during the time of their engagement
there always was something suspicious about him
pardon me and you too mr
carlsen pardon me but you look at the whole affair in rather an abstract way very abstractedly
by chance i have in my possession a very concrete report from a friend in jutland and can present the whole affair in all its details
mr ronholt you don't mean to
mr carlsen with the lady's permission
thank you he certainly did not live as one should live after a brain fever
don't you think mr
carlsen that ronholt is in a particularly good humor to day
yes but you must not forget that he exhausted all his spleen on an article in the morning paper
imagine to dare to maintain why that is pure rebellion contempt of law for him
let me see oh yes our mutual friend whom we met last year at monsted and whom as you say you knew in copenhagen has during the last months haunted the region hereabouts
he looks just as he used to he is the same pale knight of the melancholy mien
he is the most ridiculous mixture of forced gayety and silent hopelessness he is affected ruthless and brutal toward himself and others
he is taciturn and a man of few words and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself at all though he does nothing but drink and lead a riotous life
it is as i have already said as if he had a fixed idea that he received a personal insult from destiny
his associates here were especially a horse dealer called mug sexton because he does nothing but sing and drink all the time and a disreputable lanky over grown cross between a sailor and peddler known and feared under the name of peter rudderless to say nothing of the fair abelone
she however recently has had to give way to a brunette belonging to a troupe of mountebanks which for some time has favored us with performances of feats of strength and rope dancing
you have seen this kind of women with sharp yellow prematurely aged faces creatures that are shattered by brutality poverty and miserable vices and who always over dress in shabby velvet and dirty red
it is true that his fiancee met with a horrible death but that does not explain the matter
he rudderless the horse dealer and the woman sat in a drinking tent dissipating until far into the night
at three o'clock or thereabouts they were at last ready to leave
they got on the wagon and so far everything went all right but then our mutual friend turns off from the main road and drives with them over fields and heath as fast as the horses can go
the wagon is flung from one side to the other
finally things get too wild for the horse dealer and he yells that he wants to get down
after he has gotten off our mutual friend whips up the horses again arid drives straight at a large heather covered hill
the woman becomes frightened and jumps off and now up the hill they go and down on the other side at such a terrific pace that it is a miracle the wagon did not arrive at the bottom ahead of the horses
the poor fellow but this business of the woman is nasty
do you really think mr
ronholt that this description puts the man in a better light
no but in a surer one you know in the darkness things often seem larger than they are
can you think of anything worse
if not then this is the worst but you know one should never think the worst of people
then you really mean that the whole affair is not so bad that there is something bold in it something in a sense eminently plebeian which pleases your liking for democracy
aristocratic no that is lather paradoxical
if he is not a democrat then i really don't know what he is
white alders bluish lilac red hawthorn and radiant laburnum were in flower and gave forth their fragrance in front of the house
the windows were open and the blinds were drawn
mogens leaned in over the sill and the blinds lay on his back
it was grateful to the eye after all the summer sun on forest and water and in the air to look into the subdued soft quiet light of a room
a tall woman of opulent figure stood within the back toward the window and was putting flowers in a large vase
the waist of her pink morning gown was gathered high up below the bosom by a shining black leather belt on the floor behind her lay a snow white dressing jacket her abundant very blond hair was hanging in a bright red net
you look rather pale after the celebration last night was the first thing mogens said
good morning she replied and held out without turning around her hand with the flowers in it towards him
mogens took one of the flowers
laura turned the head half towards him opened her hand slightly and let the flowers fall to the floor in little lots
then she again busied herself with the vase
i won't eat breakfast with you to day
no we can't have dinner together either
no good by when are you coming back
she asked arranging her gown she went to the window and there sat down on the chair
nothing but since we are neither married nor madly in love with each other i don't see anything very strange in the fact that i am going my own way
are you jealous she asked very softly
of one like you
i haven't lost my senses
it means that i am tired of your beauty that i know your voice and your gestures by heart and that neither your whims nor your stupidity nor your craftiness can any longer entertain me
can you tell me then why i should stay
laura wept mogens mogens how can you have the heart to do this
oh what shall i shall i shall i shall i do
stay only today only to day mogens
you dare not go away from me
those are lies laura you don't even believe it yourself
it is not because you think such a terrible lot of me that you are distressed now
you are only a little bit alarmed because of the change you are frightened because of the slight disarrangement of your daily habits
i am thoroughly familiar with that you are not the first one i have gotten tired of
oh stay with me only to day i won't torment you to stay a single hour longer
you haven't a trace of fine feelings in your body
if one gives you a kick you come crawling back again
yes yes that's what we do but stay only for to day won't you stay
stay stay no you have never loved me mogens
no yes you did you loved me the day when there was such a violent wind oh that beautiful day down at the sea shore when we sat in the shelter of the boat
stupid girl if i only were a respectable girl with fine parents and not such a one as i am then you would stay with me then you would not have the heart to be so hard and i who love you so
no i am like the dust beneath your feet you care no more for me
not one kind word only hard words contempt that is good enough for me
good by laura he held out his hand to her but she kept hers on her back and wailed no no not good by
not good by mogens raised the blind stepped back a couple of paces and let it fall down in front of the window
no when he had gone a short distance she cried plaintively good by mogens
he turned towards the house with a slight greeting
then he walked on and a girl like that still believes in love
no she does not
the evening wind blew from the ocean over the land the strand grass swung its pale spikes to and fro and raised its pointed leaves a little the rushes bowed down the water of the lake was darkened by thousands of tiny furrows and the leaves of the water lilies tugged restlessly at their stalks
then the dark tops of the heather began to nod and on the fields of sand the sorrel swayed unsteadily to and fro
towards the land the stalks of oats bowed downward and the young clover trembled on the stubble fields and the wheat rose and fell in heavy billows the roofs groaned the mill creaked its wings swung about the smoke was driven back into the chimneys and the window panes became covered with moisture
mogens lay up there and gazed out over the dark earth
everything was very sad all of life all of life empty behind him dark before him
but such was life
through misfortune he had learned to see everything was full of injustice and lies the entire earth was a huge rotting lie faith friendship mercy a lie it was a lie was each and everything but that which was called love it was the hollowest of all hollow things it was lust flaming lust glimmering lust smoldering lust but lust and nothing else
why had he to know this
why had he not been permitted to hold fast to his faith in all these gilded lies
why was he compelled to see while the others remained blind
down there home stood beside home
my home my home
and my childhood's belief in everything beautiful in the world
if the world were full of beating hearts and the heavens full of a loving god
but why do i not know that why do i know something different
and i do know something different cutting bitter true
he rose fields and meadows lay before him bathed in moonlight
he went down into the village along the way past the garden of the manor house he went and looked over the stone wall
within on a grass plot in the garden stood a silver poplar the moonlight fell sharply on the quivering leaves sometimes they showed their dark side sometimes their white
he placed his elbows on the wall and stared at the tree it looked as if the leaves were running in a fine rain down the limbs
he believed that he was hearing the sound which the foliage produced
suddenly the lovely voice of a woman became audible quite near by flower in dew
flower in dew whisper to me thy dreams thine own
does in them lie the same strange air the same wonderful elfin air as in mine own
are they filled with whispers and sobbing and sighing amid radiance slumbering and fragrances dying amid trembling ringing amid rising singing in longing in longing i live
then silence fell again
mogens diew a long breath and listened intently no more singing up in the house a door was heard
now he clearly heard the sound from the leaves of the silver poplar
the next day was one of those in which late summer is rich
a day with a brisk cool wind with many large swiftly flying clouds with everlasting alternations of darkness and light according as the clouds drift past the sun
up there it looked rather barren the grass had recently been cut behind an old quadrangular iron fence stood a wide spreading low elder with waving foliage
mogens wandered about hunting for a sheltered place but the wind seemed to blow on all sides of the church
he threw himself down near the embankment drew a book out of his pocket but he did not get on with his reading every time when a cloud went past the sun it seemed to him as though it were growing chilly and he thought of getting up but then the light came again and he remained lying
a young girl came slowly along the way a greyhound and a pointer ran playfully ahead of her
she stopped and it seemed as if she wanted to sit down but when she saw mogens she continued her walk diagonally across the cemetery out through the gate
mogens rose and looked after her she walked down on the main road the dogs still played
then he began reading the inscription on one of the graves it quickly made him smile
suddenly a shadow fell across the grave and remained lying there mogens looked sideways
a tanned young man stood there one hand in his game bag in the other he held his gun
it isn't really half bad he said indicating the inscription
no said mogens and straightened up from his bent position
tell me continued the hunter and looked to the side as if seeking something you have been here for a couple of days and i have been going about wondering about you but up to the present didn't come near you
you go and drift about so alone why haven't you looked in on us
and what in the world do you do to kill the time
no i am staying here for pleasure
meanwhile i have to go down to the inn and get some small shot and while you are getting ready i can go over and call down the blacksmith
haven't you seen a girl
yes there she is she is my cousin i can't introduce you to her but come along let us follow her we made a wager now you can he the judge
she was to be in the cemetery with the dogs and i was to pass with gun and game bag but was not to call or to whistle and if the dogs nevertheless went with me she would lose now we will see
after a little while they overtook the lady the hunter looked straight ahead but could not help smiling mogens bowed when they passed
the dogs looked in surprise after the hunter and growled a bit then they looked up at the lady and barked she wanted to pat them but indifferently they walked away from her and barked after the hunter
and when they reached him they were quite out of control they jumped up on him and rushed off in every direction and back again
you lose he called out to her she nodded smilingly turned round and went on
they hunted till late in the afternoon
mogens and william got along famously and mogens had to promise that he would come to the manor house in the evening
this he did and later he came almost every day but in spite of all the cordial invitations he continued living at the inn
at first thora's proximity brought back to life all his sad and gloomy memories
often he had suddenly to begin a conversation with one of the others or leave so that his emotion might not completely master him
she was not at all like camilla and yet he heard and saw only camilla
thora was small delicate and slender roused easily to laughter easily to tears and easily to enthusiasm
if for a longer time she spoke seriously with some one it was not like a drawing near but rather as if she disappeared within her own self
if some one explained something to her or developed an idea her face her whole figure expressed the most intimate trust and now and again perhaps also expectancy
william and his little sister did not treat her quite like a comrade but yet not like a stranger either
in respect to her they were almost like a wanderer in the forest who sees close beside him one of those tiny graceful song birds with very clear eyes and light captivating movements
he is enraptured by this tiny living creature he would so much like to have it come closer and closer but he does not care to move scarcely to take breath lest it may be frightened and fly away
as mogens saw thora more and more frequently memories came more and more rarely and he began to see her as she was
it was a time of peace and happiness when he was with her full of silent longing and quiet sadness when he did not see her
later he told her of camilla and of his past life and it was almost with surprise that he looked back upon himself
sometimes it seemed inconceivable to him that it was he who had thought felt and done all the strange things of which he told
on an evening he and thora stood on a height in the garden and watched the sunset
william and his little sister were playing hide and seek around the hill
there were thousands of light delicate colors hundreds of strong radiant ones
mogens turned away from them and looked at the dark figure by his side
how insignificant it looked in comparison with all this glowing splendor he sighed and looked up again at the gorgeously colored clouds
it was not like a real thought but it came vague and fleeting existed for a second and disappeared it was as if it had been the eye that thought it
oh are they don't you know that elves love darkness
it is beautiful to believe in all that in gnomes and elves
what can one do with goblins and three legged horses
old mary gets angry when i tell her this for to believe what i believe she says is not god fearing
such things have nothing to do with people but warnings and spirits are in the gospel too
what do you say
i oh i don't know what do you really mean
you surely don't love nature
i don't mean nature as you see it from benches placed where there is a fine view on hills up which they have built steps where it is like a set scene but nature every day always
there isn't a hill so barren nor a turf pit so square nor a road so monotonous that i cannot for a moment fall in love with it
but what joy can you take in a tree or a bush if you don't imagine that a living being dwells within it that opens and closes the flowers and smooths the leaves
when you see a lake a deep clear lake don't you love it for this reason that you imagine creatures living deep deep down below that have their own joys and sorrows that have their own strange life with strange yearnings
and what for instance is there beautiful about the green hill of berdbjerg if you don't imagine that inside very tiny creatures swarm and buzz and sigh when the sun rises but begin to dance and play with their beautiful treasure troves as soon as evening comes
how wonderfully beautiful that is
but you yes i can't explain it but there is something in the color in the movements and in the shapes and then in the life which lives in them in the sap which rises in trees and flowers in the sun and rain that make them grow in the sand which blows together in hills and in the showers of rain that furrow and fissure the hillsides
and when shape and color and movement are so lovely and so fleeting and a strange world lies behind all this and lives and rejoices and desires and can express all this in voice and song then you feel so lonely that you cannot come closer to this world and life grows lusterless and burdensome
no no you must not think of your fiancee in that way
oh i am not thinking of her
on a morning several days later mogens and thora were walking in the garden
he was to look at the grape vine nursery where he had not yet been
they entered the air was warm and moist and had a peculiar heavy aromatic odor as of earth that has just been turned
the beautiful incised leaves and the heavy dewy grapes were resplendent and luminous under the sunlight
they spread out beneath the glass cover in a great green field of blessedness
thora stood there and happily looked upward mogens was restless and stared now and then unhappily at her and then up into the foliage
listen thora said gayly i think i am now beginning to understand what you said the other day on the hill about form and color
no she whispered looked quickly at him dropped the glance and grew red not then
she bent down toward him gave him one of her hands and covered her eyes with the other and wept
mogens pressed the hand against his breast as he rose she lifted her head and he kissed her on the forehead
she looked up at him with radiant moist eyes smiled and whispered heaven be praised
the arrangement was that the wedding was to take place in midsummer
then he left and winter came with dark days long nights and a snowstorm of letters
all the windows of the manor house were lighted leaves and flowers were above every door friends and acquaintances in a dense crowd stood on the large stone stairway all looking out into the dusk
thora sat and looked out of one of them at the ditch of the highway at the smith's hill where primroses blossomed in spring at bertel nielsen's huge elderberry bushes at the mill and the miller's geese and the hill of dalum where not many years ago she and william slid down on sleighs at the dalum meadows at the long unnatural shadows of the horses that rushed over the gravel heaps over the turf pits and rye field
she sat there and wept very softly from time to time when wiping the dew from the pane she looked stealthily over towards mogens
he sat bowed forward his traveling cloak was open his hat lay and rocked on the front seat his hands he held in front of his face
all the things he had to think of
she had had to say good by to all her relatives and friends and to an infinity of places where memories lay ranged in strata one above the other right up to the sky and all this so that she might go away with him
and was he the right sort of a man to place all one's trust in he with his past of brutalities and debaucheries
it was not even certain that all this was merely his past
he had changed it is true and he found it difficult to understand what he himself had been
but one never can wholly escape from one's self and what had been surely still was there
no no it shall not be thus no she is to go on living her clear bright girl's life in spite of him
darkness had set in and here and there he saw through the thickly covered panes lights in the houses and yards past which they drove
thora slumbered toward morning they came to their new home an estate that mogens had bought
the horses steamed in the chill morning air the sparrows twittered on the huge linden in the court and the smoke rose slowly from the chimneys
thora looked smiling and contented at all this after mogens had helped her out of the carriage but there was no other way about she was sleepy and too tired to conceal it
mogens took her to her room and then went into the garden sat down on a bench and imagined that he was watching the sunrise but he nodded too violently to keep up the deception
about noon he and thora met again happy and refreshed
they had to look at things and express their surprise they consulted and made decisions they made the absurdest suggestions and how thora struggled to look wise and interested when the cows were introduced to her and how difficult it was not to be all too unpractically enthusiastic over a small shaggy young dog and how mogens talked of drainage and the price of grain while he stood there and in his heart wondered how thora would look with red poppies in her hair
and in the evening when they sat in their conservatory and the moon so clearly drew the outline of the windows on the floor what a comedy they played he on his part seriously representing to her that she should go to sleep really go to sleep since she must be tired the while he continued to hold her hand in his and she on her part when she declared he was disagreeable and wanted to be rid of her that he regretted having taken a wife
then a reconciliation of course followed and they laughed and the hour grew late
finally thora went to her room but mogens remained sitting in the conservatory miserable that she had gone
he drew black imaginings for himself that she was dead and gone and that he was sitting here all alone in the world and weeping over her and then he really wept
at length he became angry at himself and stalked up and down the floor and wanted to be sensible
there was a love pure and noble without any coarse earthly passion yes there was and if there was not there was going to be one
he had been subjugated weighed down tormented by this ugly and powerful force it had lain in his eyes and ears it had poisoned all his thoughts
he went to his room
he intended to read and took a book he read but had not the slightest notion what could anything have happened to her
no how could it
but nevertheless he was afraid possibly there might have no he could no longer stand it
he stole softly to her door no everything was still and peaceful
when he listened intently it seemed as if he could hear her breathing how his heart throbbed it seemed he could hear it too
he went back to his room and his book
he closed his eyes how vividly he saw her he heard her voice she bent down toward him and whispered how he loved her loved her loved her
it was like a song within him it seemed as if his thoughts took on rhythmic form and how clearly he could see everything of which he thought
still and silent she lay and slept her arm beneath the neck her hair loosened her eyes were closed she breathed very softly the air trembled within it was red like the reflection of roses
no no he did not want to think of her not in that way for nothing in all the world no and now it all came back again it could not be kept away but he would keep it away away
and it came and went came and went until sleep seized him and the night passed
when the sun had set on the evening of the next day they walked about together in the garden
arm in arm they walked very slowly and very silently up one path and down the other out of the fragrance of mignonettes through that of roses into that of jasmine
a few moths fluttered past them out in the grain field a wild duck called otherwise most of the sounds came from thora's silk dress
then they walked again for a while and were silent
of what are you thinking now
she asked i am thinking of myself
that's just what i am doing
are you also thinking of yourself
no of yourself of you mogens
the door was open it was very light in there and the table with the snowy white cloth the silver dish with the dark red strawberries the shining silver pot and the chandelier gave quite a festive impression
oh you quite forget that in there dwells a witch who wants to put us unhappy little children into an oven and eat us
no it is much better that we resist the sugar panes and the pancake roof take each other by the hand and go back into the dark dark wood
she leaned closely toward mogens and continued it may also be the palace of the grand turk and you are the arab from the desert who wants to carry me off and the guard is pursuing us the curved sabers flash and we run and run but they have taken your horse and then they take us along and put us into a big bag and we are in it together and are drowned in the sea
why might it not be what it is
if you knew how i love you but i am so unhappy i don't know what it is there is such a great distance between us no she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him passionately and pressed her burning cheek against his i don't know how it is but sometimes i almost wish that you beat me i know it is childish and that i am very happy very happy and yet i feel so unhappy
she laid her head on his breast and wept and then she began while her tears were still streaming to sing at first very gently but then louder and louder in longing in longing
live my own little wife
in the morning he stood beside her bed
it softened all the lines in the room and made all the colors seem sated and peaceful
her head rested a little sidewise on the pillow her hair fell over her white brow one of her cheeks was a brighter red than the other now and then there was a faint quivering in the calmly arched eyelids and the lines of her mouth undulated imperceptibly between unconscious seriousness and slumbering smiles
mogens stood for a long time and looked at her happy and quiet
then he stole away softly and sat down in the living room and waited for her in silence
he had sat there for a while when he felt her head on his shoulder and her cheek against his
they went out together into the freshness of the morning
the sunlight was jubilant above the earth the dew sparkled flowers that had awakened early gleamed a lark sang high up beneath the sky swallows flew swiftly through the air
he and she walked across the green field toward the hill with the ripening rye they followed the footpath which led over there
she went ahead very slowly and looked back over her shoulder toward him and they talked and laughed
the further they descended the hill the more the grain intervened soon they could no longer be seen
the plague in bergamo old bergamo lay on the summit of a low mountain hedged in by walls and gates and new bergamo lay at the foot of the mountain exposed to all winds
one day the plague broke out in the new town and spread at a terrific speed a multitude of people died and the others fled across the plains to all four corners of the world
and the citizens in old bergamo set fire to the deserted town in order to purify the air but it did no good
people began dying up there too at first one a day then five then ten then twenty and when the plague had reached its height a great many more
and they could not flee as those had done who lived in the new town
there were some who tried it but they led the life of a hunted animal hid in ditches and sewers under hedges and in the green fields for the peasants into whose homes in many places the first fugitives had brought the plague stoned every stranger they came across drove him from their lands or struck him down like a mad dog without mercy or pity in justifiable self defense as they believed
the people of old bergamo had to stay where they were and day by day it grew hotter and day by day the gruesome disease became more voracious and more grasping
terror grew to madness
what there had been of order and good government was as if the earth had swallowed it and what was worst in human nature came in its stead
they took care that the corpses were duly and properly buried and every day saw to it that big bonfires were lighted in squares and open places so that the healthful smoke might drift through the streets
juniper and vinegar were distributed among the poor and above all else the people sought the churches early and late alone and in processions
every day they went with their prayers before god and every day when the sun was setting behind the mountains all the churchbells called wailingly towards heaven from hundreds of swinging throats
fasts were ordered and every day holy relics were set out on the altars
at last one day when they did not know what else to do from the balcony of the town hall amid the sound of trumpets and horns they proclaimed the holy virgin podesta or lordmayor of the town now and forever
and when the people felt this and the belief grew stronger that heaven either would not or could not help they not only let their hands lie idly in the lap saying let there come what may
nay it seemed as if sin had grown from a secret stealthy disease into a wicked open raging plague which hand in hand with the physical contagion sought to slay the soul as the other strove to destroy the body so incredible were their deeds so enormous their depravity
the wildest night hid not greater debauchery than was here committed in broad daylight
to day we shall eat for to morrow we die
it was as if they had set these words to music and played on manifold instruments a never ending hellish concert
yea if all sins had not already been invented they would have been invented here for there was no road they would not have followed in their wickedness
the most unnatural vices flourished among them and even such rare sins as necromancy magic and exorcism were familiar to them for there were many who hoped to obtain from the powers of evil the protection which heaven had not vouchsafed them
whatever had to do with mutual assistance or pity had vanished from their minds each one had thoughts only for himself
he who was sick was looked upon as a common foe and if it happened that any one was unfortunate enough to fall down on the street exhausted by the first fever paroxysm of the plague there was no door that opened to him but with lance pricks and the casting of stones they forced him to drag himself out of the way of those who were still healthy
and day by day the plague increased the summer's sun blazed down upon the town not a drop of rain fell not the faintest breeze stirred
from corpses that lay rotting in the houses and from corpses that were only half buried in the earth there was engendered a suffocating stench which mingled with the stagnant air of the streets and attracted swarms and clouds of ravens and crows until the walls and roofs were black with them
and round about the wall encircling the town sat strange large outlandish birds from far away with beaks eager for spoil and expectantly crooked claws and they sat there and looked down with their tranquil greedy eyes as if only waiting for the unfortunate town to turn into one huge carrion pit
it was just eleven weeks since the plague had broken out when the watchman in the tower and other people who were standing in high places saw a strange procession wind from the plain into the streets of the new town between the smoke blackened stone walls and the black ash heaps of the wooden houses
at least six hundred or more men and women old and young and they carried big black crosses between them and above their heads floated wide banners red as fire and blood
they sing as they are moving onward and heartrending notes of despair rise up into the silent sultry air
brown gray and black are their clothes but all wear a red badge on their breast
for all the time they are drawing nearer
they press upward along the steep road flanked by walls which leads up to the old town
and the black crosses sway from one side to the other in the crowd
they no longer sing neither do they speak nothing is audible but the tramping herd like sound of their naked feet
face after face plunges into the darkness of the tower gate and emerges into the light on the other side with a dazed tired expression and half closed lids
then the singing begins again a miserere they grasp their scourges more firmly and walk with a brisker step as if to a war song
they look as if they came from a famished city their cheeks are hollow their bones stand out their lips are bloodless and they have dark rings beneath their eyes
red dissipated faces stand contrasted with these pale white ones dull glances exhausted by debauchery are lowered before these piercing flaming eyes mocking blasphemers stand open mouthed before these hymns
a feeling of strange uneasiness filled the people at the sight of these strangers
some of them recognized a half crazy shoemaker from brescia among those who bore crosses and immediately the whole mob through him became a laughingstock
anyhow it was something new a distraction amid the everyday and when the strangers marched toward the cathedral everybody followed behind as they would have followed a band of jugglers or a tame bear
there were two lean gray haired philosophers who had elaborated impiety into a system they incited the people and out of the malice of their hearts stirred their passions so that with each step as they neared the church the attitude of the crowd became more threatening and their cries of anger wilder
it would not have taken much to have made them lay violent hands on those unknown flagellants
not a hundred steps from the church entrance the door of a tavern was thrown open and a whole flock of carousers tumbled out one on top of the other
they placed themselves at the head of the procession and led the way singing and bellowing with grotesquely solemn gestures all except one who turned handsprings right up the grass grown stones of the church steps
this of course caused laughter and so all entered peacefully into the sanctuary
it seemed strange to be here again to pass through this great cool space in this atmosphere pungent with the smell of old drippings from wax candles across the sunken flag stones which their feet knew so well and over these stones whose worn down designs and bright inscriptions had so often caused their thoughts to grow weary
and while their eyes half curiously half unwillingly sought rest in the gently subdued light underneath the vaults or glided over the dim manifoldness of the gold dust and smoke stained colors or lost themselves in the strange shadows of the altar there rose in their hearts a longing which could not be suppressed
in the meantime those from the tavern continued their scandalous behavior upon the high altar
a huge massive butcher among them a young man had taken off his white apron and tied it around his neck so that it hung down his back like a surplice and he celebrated mass with the wildest and maddest words full of obscenity and blasphemy
an oldish little fellow with a fat belly active and nimble in spite of his weight with a face like a skinned pumpkin was the sacristan and responded with the most frivolous refrains
the others lay drunk on the steps at full length bellowing with laughter and hiccoughing with drunkenness
they called out to them to pay close attention so that they might know what the people thought of their god here in old bergamo
for it was not so much their wish to insult god that made them rejoice in the tumult but they felt satisfaction in knowing that each of their blasphemies was a sting in the hearts of these holy people
they stopped in the center of the nave and groaned with pain their hearts boiling with hatred and vengeance
they lifted their eyes and hands to god and prayed that his vengeance might fall because of the mock done to him here in his own house
joyously they would let themselves be crushed beneath his heel if only he would triumph that cries of terror despair and repentance that were too late might rise up toward him from these impious lips
every note of it sounded like a cry for the rain of fire that overwhelmed sodom for the strength which samson possessed when he pulled down the columns in the house of the philistines
they lay kneeling row after row stripped to their waist and swung the sharp pointed and knotted cords down on their bleeding backs
wildly and madly they beat themselves so that the blood clung in drops on their hissing whips
would that they might beat themselves in still another way would that they might tear themselves into a thousand bloody shreds here before his eyes
blow upon blow until their arms dropped or until cramps turned them to knots
there they lay row on row with eyes gleaming with madness with foam round their mouths the blood trickling down their flesh
and those who watched this suddenly felt their hearts throb noticed how hotness rose into their cheeks and how their breathing grew difficult
it seemed as if something cold was growing out beneath their scalps and their knees grew weak
it seized hold of them in their brains was a little spot of madness which understood this frenzy
to feel themselves the slaves of a harsh and powerful deity to thrust themselves down before his feet to be his not in gentle piety not in the inactivity of silent prayer but madly in a frenzy of self humiliation in blood and wailing beneath wet gleaming scourges this they were capable of understanding
even the butcher became silent and the toothless philosophers lowered their gray heads before the eyes that roved about
then one from among the strangers a young monk rose up and spoke
he was pale as a sheet of linen his black eyes glowed like coals which are just going to die out and the gloomy pain hardened lines around his mouth were as if carven in wood with a knife and not like the folds in the face of a human being
he raised his thin sickly hands toward heaven in prayer and the sleeves of his robe slipped down over his lean white arms
then he spoke of hell he spoke that it is infinite as heaven is infinite of the lonely world of torments which each one of the condemned must endure and fill with his wails
seas of sulphur were there fields of scorpions flames that wrap themselves round a person like a cloak and silent flames that have hardened and plunged into the body like a spear twisted round in a wound
it was quite still breathlessly they listened to his words for he spoke as if he had seen it with his own eyes and they asked themselves is he one of the condemned sent up to us from the caverns of hell to bear witness before us
then he preached for a long time concerning the law and the power of the law that its every title must be fulfilled and that every transgression of which they were guilty would be counted against them by grain and ounce
but christ died for our sins say ye and we are no longer subject to the law
but i say unto you hell will not be cheated of a single one of you and not a single iron tooth of the torture wheel of hell shall pass beside your flesh
you build upon the cross of golgotha come come
come and look at it
i shall lead you straight to its foot
it was on a friday as you know that they thrust him out of one of their gates and laid the heavier end of a cross upon his shoulders
they made him bear it to a barren and unfruitful hill without the city and in crowds they followed him whirling up the dust with their many feet so that it seemed a red cloud was over the place
and they tore the garments from him and bared his body as the lords of the law have a malefactor exposed before the eyes of all so that all may see the flesh that is to be committed to torture
and they flung him on the cross and stretched him out and they drove a nail of iron through each of his resistant hands and a nail through his crossed feet
and they raised upright the cross in a hole in the ground but it would not stand firm and straight and they moved it from one side to the other and drove wedges and posts all around and those who did this pulled down the brims of their hats so that the blood from his hands might not drop into their eyes
and he on the cross looked down on the soldiers who were casting lots for his unstitched garment and down on the whole turbulent mob for whose sake he suffered that they might be saved and in all the multitude there was not one pitiful eye
and those below looked up toward him who hung there suffering and weak they looked at the tablet above his head whereon was written king of the jews and they reviled him and called out to him thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself
then he the only begotten son of god was taken with anger and saw that they were not worthy of salvation these mobs that fill the earth
then he leaped down upon the earth and snatched up his garment so that the dice rolled down the slope of golgotha and flung it round himself with the wrath of a king and ascended into heaven
and the cross stood empty and the great work of redemption was never fulfilled
there is no mediator between god and us there is no jesus who died for us on the cross there is no jesus who died for us on the cross there is no jesus who died for us on the cross
then the butcher pushed forward with raised threatening hands pale as a corpse and shouted monk monk you must nail him on the cross again you must
and behind him there was a hoarse hissing sound yea yea crucify crucify him
and clear and serene a single quivering voice crucify him
but the monk looked down over this wave of outstretched hands upon these distorted faces with the dark openings of screaming lips where rows of teeth gleamed white like the teeth of enraged beasts of prey and in a moment of ecstasy he spread out his arms toward heaven and laughed
then he stepped down and his people raised their banners with the rain of fire and their empty black crosses and crowded their way out of the church and again passed singing across the square and again through the opening of the tower gate
and those of old bergamo stared after them as they went down the mountain
the steep road lined by walls was misty in the light of the sun setting beyond the plain but on the red wall encircling the city the shadows of the great crosses which swayed from side to side in the crowd stood out black and sharply outlined
further away sounded the singing one or another of the banners still gleamed red out of the new town's smoke blackened void then they disappeared in the sun lit plain
there should have been roses there should have been roses of the large pale yellow ones
and they should hang in abundant clusters over the garden wall scattering their tender leaves carelessly down into the wagon tracks on the road a distinguished glimmer of all the exuberant wealth of flowers within
and they should have the delicate fleeting fragrance of roses which cannot be seized and is like that of unknown fruits of which the senses tell legends in their dreams
perhaps they might be of the small round hardy roses and they would have to hang down in slender twining branches with smooth leaves red and fresh and like a salutation or a kiss thrown to the wanderer who is walking tired and dusty in the middle of the road glad that he now is only half a mile from rome
of what may he be thinking
what may be his life
they hide one another and the road and the city but on the other side there is still a distant view
there the road swings in an indolent slow curve down toward the river down toward the mournful bridge
it is as if the weariness of many tedious miles rose out of them and settled with a heavy weight upon one and made one feel lonely and forsaken and filled one with desires and yearning
so it is much better that one should take one's ease here in a corner between high garden walls where the air lies tepid and soft and still to sit on the sunny side where a bench curves into a niche of the wall to sit there end gaze upon the shimmering green acanthus in the roadside ditches upon the silver spotted thistles and the pale yellow autumn flowers
the roses should have been on the long gray wall opposite a wall full of lizard holes and chinks with withered grass and they should have peeped out at the very spot where the long monotonous flatness is broken by a large swelling basket of beautiful old wrought iron a latticed extension which forms a spacious balcony reaching higher than the breast
it must have been refreshing to go up there when one was weary of the enclosed garden
and this they often were
they hated the magnificent old villa which is said to be within with its marble stair cases and its tapestries of coarse weave and the ancient trees with their proud large crowns pines and laurels ashes cypresses and oaks
during all the period of their growth they were hated with the hatred which restless hearts feel for that which is commonplace trivial uneventful for that which stands still and therefore seems hostile
but from the balcony one could at least range outside with one's eyes and that is why they stood there one generation after the other and all stared into the distance each one with pro and each one with his con
arms adorned with golden bracelets have lain on the edge of the iron railing and many a silk covered knee has pressed against the black arabesques the while colored ribbons waved from all its points as signals of love and rendezvous
could one but kill with a thought or open hell with a wish
women and men it is always women and men even these emaciated white virgin souls which press against the black latticework like a flock of lost doves and cry out take us
to imagined noble birds of prey
one might imagine a _proverbe_ here
as figure for the fountain a dolphin with a broken off tail and one of the nostrils stopped up
on one side of the fountain a semicircular bench of tuff and terracotta
the loose grayish white dust the reddish molded stone the hewn yellowish porous tuff the dark polished porphyry gleaming with moisture and the living tiny silvery jet of water material and colors harmonize rather well
not of a definite historical period for the pages of reality in no way correspond with the pages of the ideal
the pages here however are pages such as dream in pictures and books
accordingly it is merely the costume which has a historical effect
she is married but it lasted only a year and a half when she was divorced from her husband and she is said to have acted in anything but a proper fashion towards him
and that may well be but it is impossible to imagine anything more innocent in appearance than she
that is to say it is not the gracious elemental innocence which has such attractive qualities but it is rather the cultivated mature innocence in which no one can be mistaken and which goes straight to the heart
it captivates one with all the power which something that has reached completion only can have
she is unmarried and has no past absolutely none
there is no one who knows the least thing about her
the eyes are unfathomable and their depths are as soft and luminous as the dark petals in the flower of the pansy
the costume is of pale yellow in the manner of a corselet with wide up and down stripes a stiff ruff and buttons of topaz
and now the yellow one is standing up on the balcony leaning over the edge the while the blue is sitting on the bench down by the fountain comfortably leaning back with his ring covered hands clasped around one knee
he stares dreamily out upon the campagna
now he speaks no nothing exists in the world but women
there must be a magic in the lines out of which they are created merely when i see them pass isaura rosamond and donna lisa and the others
when i see how their garment clings around their figure and how it drapes as they walk it is as if my heart drank the blood out of all my arteries and left my head empty and without thoughts and my limbs trembling and without strength
it is as though my whole being were gathered into a single tremulous uneasy breath of desire
what is it why is it
it is as if happiness went invisibly past my door and i had to snatch it and hold it close and make it my own
then the other page speaks from his balcony and if now you sat at her feet lorenzo and lost in her thoughts she had forgotten why she had called you and you sat silent and waiting and her lovely face were bent over you further from you in the clouds of its dreams than the star in the heavens and yet so near you that every expression was surrendered to your admiration every beauty engendered line every tint of the skin in its white stillness as well as in its soft rosy glow would it not then be as if she who is sitting there belonged to another world than the one in which you kneel in adoration
would it not be as if hers were another world as if another world surrounded her in which her festively garbed thoughts are going out to meet some goal which is unknown to you
her love is far away from all that is yours from your world from everything
she dreams of far distances and her desires are of far distances
and it seems as if not the slightest space could be found for you in her thoughts however ardently you might desire to sacrifice yourself for her your life your all to the end that that might be between her and you which is hardly a faint glimmer of companionship much less a belonging together
yes you know that it is thus
it stops and looks about the tail moves
if one could only find a stone
look out my four legged friend
no you cannot hit them they hear the stone long before it reaches them
the blue one had been sitting there so prettily
and in her eyes lay a yearning which was genuine and unconscious and in her movements a nervousness that was full of presentiment
around her mouth was a faint expression of pain when she spoke and even more when she listened to the soft somewhat low voice of the yellow page which spoke to her from the balcony in words that were provocative and at the same time caressing that had a note of mockery and a note of sympathy
they have spoken of that vague young love which never finds peace but unceasingly flits through all the lands of foreboding and through all the heavens of hope this love that is dying to satisfy itself in the powerful fervent glow of a single great emotion
of this they spoke the younger one in bitter complaint the elder one with regretful tenderness
now the latter said the yellow one to the blue that he should not so impatiently demand the love of a woman to capture him and hold him bound
for believe me he said the love that you will find in the clasp of two white arms with two eyes as your immediate heaven and the certain bliss of two lips this love lies nigh unto the earth and unto the dust
it has exchanged the eternal freedom of dreams for a happiness which is measured by hours and which hourly grows older
for even if it always grows young again yet each time it loses one of the rays which in a halo surround the eternal youth of dreams
no you are happy
no you are happy answered the blue one i would give a world were i as you are
and the blue one rises and begins to walk down the road to the campagna and the yellow one looks after him with a sad smile and says to himself no he is happy
but far down the road the blue one turns round once more toward the balcony and raising his barret calls no you are happy
and now a breath of wind might come and shake a rain of rose leaves from the laden branches and whirl them after the departing page
mrs fonss in the graceful pleasure gardens behind the pope's ancient palace in avignon stands a bench from which one can overlook the rhone the flowery banks of the durance hills and fields and a part of the town
one october afternoon two danish ladies were seated on this bench mrs
although they had been here several days and were already familiar with the view before them they nevertheless sat there and marveled that this was the way the provence looked
a clayey river with flakes of muddy sand and endless shores of stone gray gravel pale brown fields without a blade of grass pale brown slopes pale brown hills and dust colored roads and here and there near the white houses groups of black trees absolutely black bushes and trees
over all this hung a whitish sky quivering with light which made everything still paler still dryer and more wearily light never a glimmer of luxuriant satiated hues nothing but hungry sun parched colors not a sound in the air not a scythe passing through the grass not a wagon rattling over the roads and the town stretching out on both sides was also as if built of silence with all the streets still as at noon time with all the houses deaf and dumb every shutter closed every blind drawn each and every one houses that could neither see nor hear
mrs fonss viewed this lifeless monotony with a resigned smile but it made elinor visibly nervous not actively nervous as in the case of annoyance but mournful and weary as one often becomes after many days of rain when all one's gloomy thoughts seem to pour down upon one with the rain or as at the idiotically consoling tick tack of a clock when one sits and grows incurably tired of one's self or at watching the flowers of the wall paper when the same chain of worn out dreams clanks about against one's will in the brain and the links are joined and come apart and in a stifling endlessness are united again
it actually had a physical effect upon her this landscape almost causing her to faint
to day everything seemed to have conspired with the memories of a hope which was dead and of sweet and lively dreams which had become disagreeable and nauseous dreams which caused her to redden when she thought of them and which yet she could not forget
the blow had fallen upon her far from here amid the surroundings of bar home by the edge of a sound with changing waters under pale green beech trees
it was the old sorrow for young hearts which had touched her
she had loved a man and believed in his love for her and suddenly he had chosen some one else
why for what reason
what had she done to him
had she changed was she no longer the same
and all the eternal questions over again
she had not said a word about it to her mother but her mother had understood every bit of it and had been very concerned about her
she could have screamed at this thoughtfulness which knew and yet should not have known her mother understood this also and for that reason they had gone traveling
the whole purpose of the journey was only that she might forget
mrs fonss did not need to make her daughter feel uneasy by scrutinizing her face in order to know where her thoughts were
all she had to do was to watch the nervous little hand which lay beside her and with such futile despair stroked the bars of the bench they changed their position every moment like a fever patient tossing from side to side in his hot bed
when she did this and looked at the hand she also knew how life weary the young eyes were that stared out into the distance how pain quivered through every feature of the delicate face how pale it was beneath its suffering and how the blue veins showed at the temples beneath the soft skin
she was very sorry for her little girl and would have loved to have had her lean against her breast and to whisper down to her all the words of comfort she could think of but she had the conviction that there were sorrows which could only die away in secret and which must not be expressed in loud words not even between a mother and daughter
otherwise some day under new circumstances when everything is building for joy and happiness these words may become an obstacle something that weighs heavily and takes away freedom
the person who has spoken hears their whisper in the soul of the other imagines them turned over and judged in the thoughts of the other
then too she was afraid of doing injury to her daughter if she made confidences too easy
she did not wish to have elinor blush before her she did want however much of a relief it might be to help her over the humiliation which lies in opening the inmost recesses of one's soul to the gaze of another
on the contrary the more difficult it became for both the more she was pleased that the aristocracy of soul which she herself possessed was repeated in her young daughter in a certain healthy inflexibility
once upon a time it was a time many many years ago when she herself had been an eighteen year old girl she had loved with all her soul with every sense in her body every living hope every thought
he had had nothing to offer except his loyalty which would have involved the test of an endlessly long engagement and there were circumstances in her home which could not wait
so she had taken the one whom they had given her the one who was master over these circumstances
they were married then came children tage the son who was with her in avignon and the daughter who sat beside her everything had turned out so much better than she could have hoped for both easier and more friendly
eight years it lasted then the husband died and she mourned him with a sincere heart
she had learned to love his fine thin blooded nature which with a tense egotistic almost morbid love loved whatever belonged to it by ties of relationship or family and cared nought for anything in all the great world outside except for what they thought what their opinion was nothing else
after her husband's death she had lived chiefly for her children but she had not devoted herself exclusively to them she had taken part in social life as was natural for so young and well to do a widow and now her son was twenty one years old and she lacked not many days of forty
but she was still beautiful
there was not a gray thread in her heavy dark blonde hair not a wrinkle round her large courageous eyes and her figure was slender with well balanced fullness
the strong fine lines of her features were accentuated by the darker more deeply colored complexion which the years had given her the smile of her widely sweeping lips was very sweet an almost enigmatical youth in the dewy luminosity of her brown eyes softened and mellowed everything again
and yet she also had the round fullness of cheek the strong willed chin of a mature woman
that surely is tage coming said mrs
fonss to her daughter when she heard laughter and some danish exclamations on the other side of the thick hedge of hornbeam
elinor pulled herself together
and it was tage tage and kastager a wholesale merchant from copenhagen with his sister and daughter mrs
kastager lay ill at home in the hotel
mrs fonss and elinor made room for the two ladies the men tried for a moment to converse standing but were lured by the low wall of stone which surrounded the spot
they sat there and said only what was absolutely necessary for the newcomers were tired from a little railway excursion they had taken into the provence with its blooming roses
look they looked out in the brown landscape appeared a cloud of dust over it a mantle of dust and between the two they caught sight of a horse
that's the englishman i told you about who came the other day said tage turning toward his mother
did you ever see any one ride like that
he asked turning toward kastager he reminds me of a gaucho
the horseman disappeared then they all rose and set out for the hotel
they had met the kastagers in belfort and since they were pursuing the same itinerary through southern france and along the riviera they for the time being traveled together
here in avignon both families had made a halt kastager because his wife had developed a varicose vein the fonss because elinor obviously needed a rest
day by day he fell more and more incurably in love with the pretty ida kastager
mrs fonss did not especially like this
though tage was very self reliant and mature for his age there was no reason for a hasty engagement and there was mr
kastager ida was a splendid little girl mrs
kastager was a very well bred woman of excellent family and kastager himself was capable rich and honest but there was a hint of the absurd about him
a smile came upon people's lips and a twinkle into their eyes when any one mentioned mr
kastager the reason for this was that he was full of fire and given to extraordinary enthusiasms he was frankly ingenuous boisterous and communicative and nowadays it requires a great deal of tact to be lavish with enthusiasm
but mrs fonss could not bear the thought that tage's father in law should be mentioned with a twinkle in the eye and a smile round the mouth and for that reason she exhibited a certain coldness toward the family to the great sorrow of the enamored tage
on the morning of the following day tage and his mother had gone to look at the little museum of the town
they found the gate open but the doors to the collection locked ringing the bell proved fruitless
the gateway however gave admission to the not specially large court which was surrounded by a freshly whitewashed arcade whose short squat columns had black iron bars between them
they walked about and looked at the objects placed along the wall roman sepulchral monuments pieces of sarcophagi a headless draped figure the dorsal vertebra of a whale and a series of architectural details
tage ran up the stairs to see if there might not be people somewhere in the house and mrs
as she was on the turn toward the gate a tall man with a bearded tanned face appeared at the end of the passage directly in front of her
he had a guide book in his hand he listened for something and then looked forward straight at her
the englishman of yesterday immediately came to her mind
pardon me he began interrogatively and bowed
i am a stranger mrs
fonss replied nobody seems to be at home but my son has just run upstairs to see whether
i have been everywhere he said even in the living quarters but didn't find as much as a cat
i hear said the englishman this time in danish that i have the pleasure of being with fellow countrymen
he bowed again and retreated a couple of steps as if to indicate that he had merely said this to let them know that he understood what they were saying
suddenly he stepped closer than before with an intent eager expression on his face and said to mrs
exclaimed mrs fonss and held out her hand
he seized it yes i am he he said gayly and you are she
his eyes almost filled with tears as he looked at her
mrs fonss introduced tage as her son
tage had never in his life heard mention of thorbrogger but that was not his thoughts he thought only of the fact that this gaucho turned out to be a dane when a pause set in and some one had to say something he could not help exclaiming and i who said yesterday that you reminded me of a gaucho
well replied thorbrogger that wasn't far from the truth for twenty one years i have lived in the plains of la plata and in those years certainly spent more time on horse back than on foot
yes he had sold his land and his sheep and had come back to have a look around in the old world where he belonged but to his shame he had to confess that he often found it very much of a bore to travel about merely for pleasure
no he had never had any special feeling for places and countries he thought it was only his daily work which he missed
at last the custodian appeared hot and out of breath with heads of lettuce under his arms and a bunch of scarlet tomatoes in his hand and they were admitted into the small stuffy collection of paintings where they gained only the vaguest impression of the yellow thunder clouds and black waters of old vernet but on the contrary told each other with considerable detail of their lives and the happenings during all the years since they had parted
for it was he whom she had loved at the time when she married another
in the days which now followed they were much together and the others thinking that such old friends must have much to say to each other left them often alone
in those days both soon noticed that however much they might have changed during the course of the years their hearts had forgotten nothing
perhaps it was he who first became aware of this for all the uncertainty of youth its sentimentality and its elegiac mood came upon him simultaneously and he suffered under it
it seemed out of place to the mature man that he should so suddenly be robbed of his peace of life and the self possession which he had acquired during the course of time and he wanted his love to bear a different stamp wished it to be graver more subdued
she did not feel herself younger but it seemed to her as if a fountain of tears that had been obstructed and dammed had burst open again and begun to flow
there was great happiness and relief in crying and these tears gave her a feeling of richness it was as if she had become more precious and everything had become more precious to her in short it was a feeling of youth after all
the purpose of this article is to present in a brief and simple manner the leading principles on which the science of meteorology is founded rather however in the spirit of an inquirer than of a teacher
if a child is found to have been starved to death in a cellar or an attic a cry of horror is raised over it
if the cochituate or mystic water is too much like an obsolete chowder up go all noses and out come all manner of newspaper paragraphs from senex tax payer and the rest
for notwithstanding the rapid progress it has made within the last thirty years it is far from having the authority of an exact science many of its phenomena are as yet inexplicable and many differences of opinion among the learned remain unreconciled on points at first sight apparently easy to be settled
this high death rate has been shown to be largely due to the excessive mortality among infants and children under five years of age
the destroying angel carries off the firstborn and oftener still the last born out of almost every household in certain districts as in the heaviest curse laid on egypt
that point is the influence of the air they breathe on the health of children with the bearing of this on the question before us
let me relate a circumstance which happened in ireland to which circumstance in all probability i owe the pleasure of being listened to at this moment by some among our hard working adopted citizens who are before me
i wish to call your attention to a single point intimately connected with the alarming fact of the excessive death rate of which i have spoken
of the uses of these larger breathing spaces which we call parks for the relief of the imprisoned dwellers in crowded streets for the recreation of poor and rich alike for the health of mind and body which they offer to all it seems almost needless to speak from the medical point of view for all know what cities would be without open areas where children can play in the shade and old people warm themselves in the sun
spherical vapor and atmospheric space give but a faint idea of its range
the most fatal of the diseases which assail them is that destruction which wasteth at noonday to which our american practitioners give the name of cholera infantum
we can and do submit the dwellings of our citizens to inspection and sanitary regulation we can and shall provide our city with proper drainage we can and do inspect the food in our market and condemn it if unfit for use we can and must secure for our citizens the influences of unroofed and unwalled nature air light space for exercise and recreation the natural birthright of mankind
we find it a leading science in physics and having intimate relations with heat light electricity magnetism winds water vegetation geological changes optical effects pneumatics geography and with climate controlling the pursuits and affecting the character of the human race
but there are certain agencies which we can to a great extent control
our climatic influences are permanent factors and must always count in the bills of mortality
it is so intimately blended indeed with the other matters here named as scarcely to have any positive boundary of its own and its vista seems ever lengthening as we proceed
without dwelling upon the numerous consequences which flow from meteorological influences let us see what is properly included under the subject of meteorology
you will not ask for rhetoric or eloquence in the few remarks upon a vital subject to be offered you by a member of the silent profession
if two or three wandering boys as it happened the other day at lowell come upon some noxious roots and in obedience to their omnivorous instinct devour them and pay the forfeit the whole country hears of it
and this disease prevails chiefly almost entirely from june to october the season when all out of door influences are most tempting and most needed
this is a gaseous vapor bearing elastic fluid surrounding the earth
it is composed of 21 parts in weight of oxygen and 77 of nitrogen with a little carbonic acid aqueous vapor and a trace of carburetted hydrogen
a considerable part of this mortality it may be feared is unavoidable
there are numerous well known calculations of the proportions of the various constituents of the atmosphere which we owe to priestley dalton black cavendish liebig and others but that given by professor ansted is sufficiently simple and intelligible
in 10 volumes or parts of it he gives to oxygen the great supporter of life 2
18 against 23.7 that of the great paved nation of london against 19
100 nitrogen not condensible under 50 atmospheres and not respirable or combustible 7
it is _usual_ to state the proportions of air as being 1 oxygen to 4 nitrogen
but air poisoning kills a hundred where food poisoning kills one
it is a curious fact that while there are six varieties of compounds of nitrogen and oxygen but one of these is fitted to sustain life and that is our atmosphere
it is well enough to note that when we use the word volume or measure in speaking of the atmosphere or any gaseous body we adopt the theory of gay lussac who discovered that gases unite with each other in definite proportions whenever they enter into combination
this theory led to important results for by knowing the elements of a compound gas we easily determine its specific gravity
it has been attempted to apply the principle to organic bodies but it has not yet been carried to a full and satisfactory conclusion
it may be noticed too that dalton affirmed that simple substances unite with each other in definite weights to form compound substances thus supporting the idea of lussac
various modifications of the principle have been from time to time presented to public attention
whether the constituents of the atmosphere are chemically or mechanically combined one of the things about which the learned are not fully agreed it is found to be chemically the same in its constituents all over the world whether collected on mountains or on plains on the sea or on the land whether obtained by a毛ronauts miles above the earth or by miners in their deepest excavations
if a family or two get hold of some ill conditioned meat and suffer for it the groans of their colics are echoed all over the land
on the theory of its mechanical combination however as by volume and that each constituent acts freely for itself and according to its own laws important speculations conclusions indeed have arisen both as regards temperature and climatic differences
it should be observed that volume as we have used the word is the apparent space occupied and differs from mass which is the _effective_ space occupied or the real bulk of matter while density is the relation of mass to volume or the quotient resulting from the division of the one by the other
those empty spaces which render the volume larger than the mass are technically called its pores
has the composition of the atmosphere changed in the lapse of years
on this point both french and german philosophers have largely speculated
it is computed that it contains about two millions of cubic geographical miles of oxygen and that 12,500 cubic geographical miles of carbonic acid have been breathed out into the air or otherwise given out in the course of five thousand years
thousands have fled the city as they deserted london in the season of the plague but thousands are left to follow in the funeral procession of those who were the hope of their households
3 that of philadelphia and approaching that of our two unhealthiest cities new york and new orleans
the inference then should be that the latter exists in the air in the proportion of 1 to 160 whereas we find but 4 parts in 10,000
dumas and bossingault decided that no change had taken place verifying their conclusion by experiments founded on observations for more than thirty five years
no _chemical_ combination of oxygen and nitrogen has ever been detected in the atmosphere and it is presumed none will be
if a milkman misrepresents his honest cows by falsifying their product the chemist detects him and the press puts him in the pillory
the atmosphere possesses as may be readily imagined many important characteristics
one of these is weight
the discovery of the _fact_ is attributed to the illustrious galileo but to modern science we owe all the certainty variety and elegance of the demonstration
a vessel containing a quantity of air is weighed the air is exhausted from it and it is weighed again
an accurate scale will then detect the difference of weight
a cubic foot of air weighs 1
2 oz hence a column of air of one inch in diameter and a mile in height weighs 44 oz
the whole pressure at the surface of the earth is estimated to be 15 lbs
to the square inch a person of ordinary size is consequently pressed upon by a weight of from 13 to 14 tons
happily for us the pressure from without is counteracted by the pressure from within
the weight of the air is of great importance in the economy of nature since it prevents the excessive evaporation of the waters upon the earth's surface and limits its extent by unalterable laws
water boils at a certain temperature when at the earth's surface where the weight of the atmosphere is greatest but at different temperatures at different elevations from the surface
on the high plains of quito 8,724 feet above the sea it boils at 194 and an egg cannot be cooked there in an open vessel
at potos铆 the boiling point is still lower being 188 and the barometrical column stands at 18
indeed the experiment is often exhibited at our chemical lectures of a flask containing a small quantity of water which exhausted of air is made to boil by the ordinary heat of the hand
the late professor forbes of edinburgh whose untimely death the friends of science have had so much reason to deplore ascertained that the temperature of boiling water varied arithmetically with the height and at the rate of one degree of the thermometric scale for every 549
what could be so eloquent as the hollow voice which announces the boston annual death rate as being 26
05 feet multiplying the difference of the boiling point by this number of feet we have the elevation
the weight of the atmosphere as indicated by the barometer is also a means for ascertaining the height of mountains or of plains but correction must be made for the effects of expansion or contraction and for capillarity or the attraction between the mercury and the glass tube at least whenever great exactness is required
tables for the convenience of calculation are given in several scientific works and particularly in a paper of professor forbes ed
trans vol 15 briefly however we may state that between 0 and 32 34 thousandths of an inch must be allowed for depression or contraction and between 32 and 52 33 thousandths
the weight of the atmosphere is not only affected by rarefaction but by currents of air which give it a sudden density or rarity
a common experiment to prove the weight of air is that of the magdeburg hemispheres a simple contrivance of otto guericke a merchant of that city
it is a part of every complete philosophical apparatus
the air within being exhausted it will be found difficult to separate them
if the superficies be 100 square inches and the height of the mercury be 30 inches the atmosphere will press on these hemispheres with a weight of 1,475 lbs requiring the efforts of seven or eight powerful men to tear them asunder
one of these instruments of the diameter of a german ell required the strength of 24 horses to separate it
and a large number of princes and nobles much to their astonishment
as compared with water the air the barometer indicating 30 and the thermometer 55 is 833 times lighter
it is this weight of the atmosphere which counterbalances that of a column of mercury 29 inches in height and a column of water 32 to 34 feet in height
the old quaint notion of nature's abhorring a vacuum was found to be practically only an assertion that the air had weight
the ordinary pump commonly called the suction pump is constructed on this principle
the weight of the atmosphere at the level of the sea is found to be the same all over the world
however it may be compressed air returns on liberation to its original volume and while thus perfectly elastic it is also the most compressible of bodies
this elasticity arises from the repulsive force of its particles and is always equal to the compressive force which it balances
a glass vessel full of air placed under a receiver and then exhausted by the air pump will burst into atoms
water on the other hand is almost the reverse
twenty cubic inches introduced into a cannon whose sides are three inches thick cannot be compressed into nineteen inches without bursting it
this non elastic property of water with another that of communicating when under the action of any force an equal pressure in all directions led to the invention of the hydraulic press
the elasticity of the air enables fishes to rise and sink in water through the action of the air bladder
the sudden compression of air liberates its latent heat and produces fire
brockhaus says that air has as yet been compressed only into one eighth of its original bulk
for every degree of heat between the freezing point and the boiling point 32 and 212 the expansion of air is about 1 490th part so that any invention which seeks to use rarefied air as a motive power must employ a very intense degree of heat enough to fuse many kinds of metals
boyle and to henry cavendish both of great britain we are indebted for most of what we know of this particular property of the air
it has been found to be 770 times less than that of water and 770 cubic inches of air weigh as much as a cubic inch of water
it is in direct ratio with its elasticity and there are tables by which it may be determined at different altitudes
as we proceed in the consideration of our general subject we shall find under the appropriate heads that density is not without material influence on reflection and refraction on transparency and the transmission of light the presence or absence of moisture and the amount of heat at the earth's surface and we might add on health and the increase or diminution of the vital energies
temperature is another branch of our subject and one involving a series of subordinate topics on which volumes have been written and to which are still devoted the labors of the most learned men of our day
temperature is the degree of heat or cold in the particles of all bodies which is perceptible by sensation and is measurable by their expansion or contraction
it is the key to the theory of the winds of rain of aerial and oceanic currents of vegetation and climate with all their multifarious and important differences
while the inclined position of the earth on its axis and its movement in its elliptical orbit influence the general amount of heat it is rather to the consequences of these in detail that we are called when we speak of temperature
if the sun shone on a uniformly level surface everywhere of the same conducting and radiating power there would be but little difficulty in tracing the monotonous effects of temperature
the reformer luther as eccentric as he was learned and sincere is reported to have said that if he had been consulted at the creation he would have placed the sun directly over the centre of the world and kept it there to give unchanging and uniform light and heat
it is certainly much better that he was not consulted
in that case every parallel of latitude would have been isothermal or of equal mean annual temperature
the seasons would have been invariable in character
vegetation instead of being universal would have been confined to a narrow zone and the whole human race would have been driven together into one limited habitable space to interfere with incommode and destroy each other
we find very important modifications of temperature occasioned not only by astronomical influences but by local causes and geographical characteristics
for while as a general rule the nearer we approach the equator the warmer we shall be yet temperature is greatly affected by mountains seas currents of air or water by radiation by forests and by vegetation
it is found in fact that the lines of temperature the happy conception of humboldt when they are traced upon the map are anything but true zones or circles
the line of the greatest mean warmth is not coincident with the equator but falls to the north of it
long from greenwich is 4 below the geographical equator at 80 it is about 6 north sweeping along the coast of new granada at 20 it comes down and touches the equator at 40 e
long it crosses the red sea about 16 north of the equator and at 120 it falls at borneo several degrees below it and the points of the greatest heat in this line are in abyssinia nearer the tropic of cancer than to the equator
on the other hand the greatest mean cold points according to the opinions of humboldt sir david brewster and others do not coincide as would seem natural with the geographical poles but they are both to be found in the northern hemisphere in latitude 80 95 e
if this be the fact but it is not positively admitted an open sea at the pole may be considered as probable on the ground of its having a higher mean temperature than is found at 80
kaemptz places one of these cold points at the north of barrow's straits the other near cape taimur in siberia
burghaus in his atlas transfers the american cold pole to 78 n
lat it is perhaps too early to determine rigorously the true temperature of these points
a noticeable fact also is this that places in the same latitude rarely receive the same amount of heat
lat is 5 below the freezing point while at naples which is north of pekin it seldom if ever goes below it and paris 500 miles farther north has a mean winter temperature of 6 above the freezing point
the city of new york about 11 south of london has a winter temperature of much greater severity
the mean temperature of the state of new york as determined by a long series of observations is 44 31
the mean temperature of countries is found to be very stable and but very small variations have been detected in modern times
but that there have been important climatic changes since the christian era cannot be doubted unless we doubt history
not many centuries ago it was a common thing for all the british rivers to freeze up during the winter and to remain so for several months
if space permitted an interesting statement could he made of the changes which have taken place in vegetation in greenland and throughout certain northern parts of europe also in palestine greece and other southern countries while we know that the earth's inclination upon its axis has been unchanged
mrs very it exist i care to attractor is all be computed from fact death sun feet of which i have spoken
that its point is a distribution of the amount if they breathe it on wellness of all bairn with stratum of the covering on a inquiry before us lowell
if few sea is not found to have been starved to its season by the cellar or zero some surface the horror is lift over engineering
if 46 or three wandering feet nearer as it is happened more temperature at us could come we upon roots and in indentation zero them and render it of a would melt than a state of it
if an unit or two render clasp of the below considered meat and endure it for it the moan of rays are distributed over land
the sun instead of sending up his beams while 18 below the visible horizon would come upon us out of an intense darkness pass over our sky a brazen inglorious orb and set in an instant amid unwelcome night
reflection is the rebound of the rays of light or heat from an opposing surface at the same angle as that at which they fall upon it
these are called angles of incidence and reflection and are equal
this may be observed when a rod is placed slantingly in a vessel of clear water the part immersed will appear bent or broken
the atmosphere absorbs some portion of the light which it receives
it is not all reflected or refracted or even penetrative
objects seen under various degrees of light either convected or retarded by different media appear near or distant distinct or confused
thus we are often surprised at the apparent nearness and brightness of an opposite shore or neighboring island in some conditions of the air while at other times they seem distant and lie in shadowy obscurity
the looming up of a vessel on the water is another common instance of the principle of refraction

but if the distractions be voluntary there is sin but unless the mind be altogether filled with distractions not thinking of god of prayer of the words or of the meaning and unless the distractions are _fully voluntary_ and _reflective_ during a notable part of the office there is no mortal sin

for example if a priest setting out on a long journey forgets to take his breviary or leaves it in a railway carriage and cannot procure another or cannot procure another without great inconvenience he is exempt from the obligation of his office and the omission being involuntary is sinless

ii again even if god speaks to an unmortified soul it cannot hear him as the passions fix its attention on worldly matters
a difficulty arises sometimes as regards the full or partial or non exemption of those who foresee that serious occupation which cannot be neglected must arise to prevent the recitation of the hours
for the presence of god who is the source of every good and the author of every best gift is a certain pledge of divine protection and of that peace and consolation which the world cannot give
for instance if a priest remembers having started the recitation of a lesson and in a short time finds himself at the end of it and cannot be sure if he have recited it the presumption is in favour of the priest and of the recitation because it is his custom to recite completely whatever part he commences
but if you cannot read or repeat a part equivalent to a small hour you are bound to nothing as a part so small less than a small hour taken separately is considered inappreciable for the end the church's law of recitation has in view
cor ii 14 the human soul cannot truly unite itself to god if the passions are not conquered because by their very nature they are opposed to god and hence inspire estrangement from and disgust for holy things
thirdly they are bound to recite clearly and distinctly but even if they cannot hear distinctly the alternate choir or even if they recite in a low voice they fulfil the obligation of recitation and canons are bound at cathedral offices to sing and chant or to lose their manual distributions and the fruits of their prebends
matt xv 3 the church appears to demand internal attention at prayer for although she has not given any positive precept dealing with this kind of attention she does the same thing when she commands that the recitation of the divine office take the form of prayer for god's honour and this recitation of words cannot be true prayer without internal attention

douglas jerrold's reputation depends upon his work in _punch_ and his writing of plays of which nearly seventy stand to his credit
not in any case that miss delageeve's plot could be called exactly convincing
to such a mind the outbreak of war with germany may well have seemed the last horror
somewhere he writes i expect i shall be a stronger pacifist after the war than any of the people who are pacifists now
i am afraid that this comedy and even _black eyed susan_ jerrold's greatest triumph have passed away into the limbo of forgotten plays and can never return to us
i may add that i was continually aware of a certainty that miss delagreve will do very much better when she selects a simpler and less affected subject
for him alone i should regard the book as one not to be missed by anyone who values a handling of character at once delicate and masterful
the spirit in which he entered the war is shown in an extract from a letter what we have got to do in the interest of europe is to fight germany without passion with respect

again the setting is wild west on the mexican border the theme of the tale being the outrages inflicted upon american citizens by villa and what seemed then the bewildering delay of washington over the vindication of the flag
_dave_ round whom the story revolves is a pleasant study of a type of american youth which we are coming gratefully to estimate at its true worth but in the development of the theme _dave_ soon becomes almost insignificant beside the greater figure of the cowboy _monte latarette_

strangely in one of his social views he carried this admiration even to the extent of advocating a teutonic control that should include holland
caudle's curtain lectures the story of a feather and countless other articles which suited the taste of the public of that day

sir rider's hand has lost none of its cunning and though his dialogue occasionally provokes a smile when one feels that seriousness is demanded he is here as successful as ever in creating or at any rate in reproducing atmosphere
my own contribution will be a sincere regret that a writer as gifted as mr
_lily of the alley_ cassell is in spite of a title of which i cannot too strongly disapprove as successful a piece of work of its own kind as anyone need wish for showing the author to have made a notable advance in his art
his theme symbolised by a wrapper design of three figures silhouetted against a golden sunrise is a second advent of the messiah embodied in the person of a village carpenter named with palpable significance _john smith_ whom local prejudice sends not inexcusably to a madhouse where he dies after converting the inmates and instituting a campaign of universal peace

and fantasy of this kind consorts but ill with a scheme that embraces such realities as heart failure and typhus
even after a rescued and refreshed _lily_ is brought up country she is kept so to speak as long as possible at the base and only arrives on the actual scene of _dave's_ activities in time to be bustled hurriedly out of the way of the final and wonderfully thrilling chapters
where now is a five act comedy entitled _bubbles of the day_ which at the time of its production was described as one of the wittiest and best constructed comedies in the english language
culley's difficulties may have lain in the fact that when the tale following _dave_ had finally shaken itself from the dust of cities the need for feminine society was conspicuously less urgent

mr edmund gosse contributes a foreword to the present volume in which he draws a pathetic picture of the author still unconquerably young despite his years facing the future with only one fear that of the unemployment to which his increasing deafness and the break up of the world as it was before the war seemed to be condemning him
_scot_ ay d'ye mind my face
_further memories_ was we are told undertaken as some sort of a safeguard against this menace of stagnation

when an unstable young wife getting tired of a pedantic husband in the way so familiar to students of novels goes off with a companion more to her taste anyone can foresee trouble or what would there be to write about
when further her detestable lover seeking change and fearing the financial lash of his properly indignant parent terminates the arrangement even an observer of real life can guess that her return to her rightful lord and master must entail disagreeables but only a reader well brazened in modern fiction could expect don juan promptly to make love to and marry the husband's sister without a word of apology to anyone
how grimly those last two words sound now

mann's new story _the victim_ hodder and stoughton is no exception
not a very attractive programme but all the same the volume has one or two redeeming features
for one thing the sister is clearly and attractively drawn and so is the picture on the wrapper though it represents no particular incident to be traced in the pages of the volume which it adorns
writing more strongly than is perhaps her wont mrs
mann has taken some trouble to emphasise the fact that in these cases of uncontrolled passion the major penalty of guilt is borne not by the offenders themselves but by the first generation succeeding
this does need saying occasionally i suppose and to that extent _the victim_ redeems itself from the charge of trivial unpleasantness
mr j rath has really discovered a new type of heroine new at least this side the atlantic
his farm bred _sadie_ a buffalo shirt packer classifies men by the sizes of their shirts has no use for any swain with a chest measurement under forty and eventually in a most original way finds her hero in _mister 44_ methuen an enormous canadian engineer and sportsman
she is no chicken herself and has a passion to be free of the city and out in the great open
_sadie_ is more than big she is beautiful burnished copper haired sincere and kind and though i think the author gets this over quite well i liked her best before she found her man and her _robinson crusoe_ adventures among the islands of ontario and was giving back chat to the little foreman in the factory
here she is a pure delight and in these days when a knowledge of the american language may come in handy at any moment this amiable romance may well be recommended as an attractive manual of first aid in the matter

of course he turns up again but such a physical wreck that the minx whom he was to have married breaks off the engagement
naturally the sweet girl friend of _mark's_ childhood undertakes to fill the gap
the minx _bel alison_ is so scathingly drawn that from sheer perversity i found myself hunting for one good point in her character but without a find
on the other hand _lady forsyth_ _mark's_ mother and a quiet capable man called _macnair_ are admirably put before us
yet at best there remains the conviction that the war is terribly real that these attempts to romance about it are almost bound to be as superficial as they are superfluous

volume i note the memoir here given to the public is based on a biographical sketch prepared by the writer at the request of the massachusetts historical society for its proceedings
of how many writers of thirty volumes can we say the same
the historic position also of every writer is an indispensable key to many things in his teaching
in such cases misdirected and uncontrolled sensibility ends in mournful waste of their own energy in the certain disappointment of their own aims and where such sensibility is backed by genius eloquence and a peculiar set of public conditions in prolonged and fatal disturbance of society
why should society with its long and deep hidden processes of growth its innumerable intricacies and far off historic complexities be as an open book to any reader of its pages who brings acuteness and passion but no patience nor calm accuracy of meditation
a safer position is this that the means prepare the end and the end is what the means have made it

he draws its general moral lesson from the french revolution and with clangorous note warns all whom it concerns from king to churl that imposture must come to an end
the golden gospel of silence is effectively compressed in thirty fine volumes
we are not promoting the objects which the social union subsists to fulfil nor applying with energetic spirit to the task of preparing a sounder state for our successors
there are conditions when indirect solvents are most powerful as there are others which these have done much to prepare when no lover of truth will stoop to declarations other than direct
belief is the mood which emancipates us from the paralysing dubieties of distraught souls and leaves us full possession of ourselves by furnishing an unshaken and inexpugnable base for action and thought and subordinating passion to conviction
the fact that to the eighteenth century belong the subjects of more than half of these thirty volumes is a proof of the fascination of the period for an author who has never ceased to vilipend it
carlyle with each of them thought is an aspiration and justice a sentiment and society a retrogression
but society and its benefits are all so much ground won from nature and her state
the prophet who never wearies of declaring that only in bowing down before the higher does man feel himself exalted touched solemn organ notes that awoke a response from dim religious depths never reached by the stormy wailings of the byronic lyre
mr carlyle has been a most powerful solvent but it is the tendency of solvents to become merely historic
a complex series of historic facts do not usually fit so neatly into the moral formula
a carlylean anthology or volume of the master's sentences might easily be composed that should contain the highest form of private liturgy accepted by the best of the industrial classes masters or men
most important of all their too slight sanctity had utterly left the old conceptions of public law and international right
and in many respects 1740 is as important a date in the history of western societies as 1789
some of the most generous spirits a hundred years ago found this in the eloquence of rousseau and some of the most generous spirits of this time and place have found it in the writer of the _sartor_
16 if the writer of this had only thought it out to the end and applied the conclusions thereof to history and politics what a difference it would have made
in a country overrun and corroded to the heart as great britain is with cant and a foul mechanical hypocrisy this temper ought to have had its uses in giving a much needed robustness to public judgment
after all has been said about self indulgent mannerisms moral perversities phraseological outrages and the rest these volumes will remain the noble monument of the industry originality conscientiousness and genius of a noble character and of an intellectual career that has exercised on many sides the profoundest sort of influence upon english feeling

but it is one thing to study historically the ideas which have influenced our predecessors and another thing to seek in them an influence fruitful for ourselves
this circumstance is honourable both to them and to him as far as it goes but it furnishes some reason for suspecting that our most vigorous moral reformer so far from propelling us in new grooves has in truth only given new firmness and coherency to tendencies that were strongly marked enough in the national character before
why should society be the one field of thought in which a man of genius is at liberty to assume all his major premisses and swear all his conclusions
we are amply justified in employing towards them wherever their offences endanger order the same methods of coercion which originally made society possible
where organic growths are concerned patience is the sovereign law and where the organism is a society of men the vital principle is a sense in one shape or another of the dignity of humanity
only the failures are used to point the great historical moral and if bonaparte had died in the tuileries in all honour and glory he would have ranked with frederick or francia as a wholly true man
his splendid drama of the french revolution has done and may be expected long to continue to do more to bring before our slow moving and unimaginative public the portentous meaning of that tremendous cataclysm than all the other writings on the subject in the english language put together
by that edict the historian tells us the french protestants who numbered perhaps a tenth of the total population 2,000,000 out of 20,000,000 obtained absolute liberty of conscience performance of public worship in 3500 castles as well as in certain specified houses in each province a state endowment equal to 20,000 a year civil rights equal in every respect to those of the catholics admission to the public colleges hospitals etc
spiritual nullity and material confusion in a society are not to be repaired by a transformation of egotism querulous brooding marvelling into egotism active practical objective not uncomplacent
in other words society does not really progress in its bulk and the methods which were conditions of the original formation and growth of the social union remain indispensable until the sound of the last trump
another consideration is that no philosophic writer however ardently his words may have been treasured and followed by the people of his own time can well be cherished by succeeding generations unless his name is associated through some definable and positive contribution with the central march of european thought and feeling
this is so notorious that it is amazing how so many people can go on freely and rapidly labelling thinkers or writers with names which they themselves are not competent to bestow and which their hearers are not competent either to understand generally or to test in the specific instance
in other words the writer who in these days has done more than anybody else to fire men's hearts with a feeling for right and an eager desire for social activity has with deliberate contempt thrust away from him the only instruments by which we can make sure what right is and that our social action is wise and effective
the least important thing about johnson is that he was a tory and about burns that he drank too much and was incontinent and if we see in modern literature an increasing tendency to mount to this higher point of view this humaner prospect there is no living writer to whom we owe more for it than mr
there was once a better side to it all when the injunction to seek and cling to fact was a valuable warning not to waste energy and hope in seeking lights which it is not given to man ever to find with a solemn assurance added that in frank and untrembling recognition of circumstance the spirit of man may find a priceless ever fruitful contentment
all this we may see and show that we see and yet so throw it behind the weightier facts of nobleness and sacrifice of the boundless gifts which fraternal union has given and has the power of giving as to kindle in every breast not callous to exalted impressions the glow of sympathetic endeavour and of serene exultation in the bond that makes precious the soul of man to man
mr carlyle has indeed written that generation stands indissolubly woven with generation how we inherit not life only but all the garniture and form of life and work and speak and even think and feel as our fathers and primeval grandfathers from the beginning have given it to us how mankind is a living indivisible whole
18 it is curious that an observer who could see the positive side of frederick's disruption of europe in 1740 did not also see that there was a positive side to the disruption of the french monarchy fifty years afterwards and that not only was a blow dealt to sham kingship but a decisive impulse was given to those ideas of morality and justice in government upon which only real kingship in whatever form is able to rest
the life of frederick the second whatever judgment we may pass upon its morality or even upon its place as a work of historic art is a model of laborious and exhaustive narration of facts not before accessible to the reader of history
one school has maintained the virtually unmeaning doctrine that the will is free and therefore its followers never gave any quarter to the idea that man was as proper an object of scientific scrutiny morally and historically as they could not deny him to be anatomically and physiologically
bartholomew whose dramatic horror has made its historic importance to be vastly exaggerated the protestant cause remained full of vitality and the number of its adherents went on increasing until the edict of nantes
carlyle calls it to the public executioner a division of the honours of social surgery which is no more than fair while in the second place he redeems the brutality of the military surgical idea after a fashion by an extraordinary mysticism which led him to see in war a divine inscrutable force determining success in a manner absolutely defying all the speculations of human reason
that a society should be likely to last with hollow and scanty faith with no government with a number of institutions hardly one of them real with a horrible mass of poverty stricken and hopeless subjects that if it should last it could be regarded as other than an abomination of desolation he has boldly and often declared to be things incredible
the moral movements to which the instinctive impulses of humanity fallen on evil times uniformly give birth early christianity for instance or the socialism of rousseau may destroy a society but they cannot save it unless in conjunction with organising policy
12 yes but deep souls dealing with the practical questions of society do well to thrust the vision as far from them as they can and to suppose that this world is no show and happiness and misery not mere appearances but the keenest realities that we can know
iii ch vii every modification of society is one of the slow growths of time and to hurry impatiently after them by swift ways of military discipline and peremptory law making is only to clasp the near and superficial good
mr carlyle's history of the rise and progress of the power of the prussian monarchy is the great illustration of the hold which he has got of the conception of the international state as a state of nature and here again in so far as he has helped to teach us to study the past by historic methods he has undoubtedly done laudable work
while kings cloaks and church tippets are never spared still less suffered to protect the dishonour of ignoble wearers of them the inadequateness of aggression and demolition the necessity of quiet order the uncounted debt that we owe to rulers and to all sorts of holy and great men who have given this order to the world all this brought repose and harmony into spirits that the hollow thunders of universal rebellion against tyrants and priests had worn into thinness and confusion
does it tend to spread faith in that cunning violence force which were once primitive and natural conditions of life and which will still by natural law work to their own proper triumphs in so far as these conditions survive and within such limits and in such sense as they permit or on the contrary does it tend to heighten respect for civic law for pledged word for the habit of self surrender to the public good and for all those other ideas and sentiments and usages which have been painfully gained from the sterile sands of egotism and selfishness and to which we are indebted for all the untold boons conferred by the social union on man
depth of benevolent feeling is unhappily no proof of fitness for handling complex problems and a fine sense of the picturesque is no more a qualification for dealing effectively with the difficulties of an old society than the composition of wordsworth's famous sonnet on westminster bridge was any reason for supposing that the author would have made a competent commissioner of works
granting the absolute and entire inadequateness of political economy to sum up the laws and conditions of a healthy social state and no one more than the present writer deplores the mischief which the application of the maxims of political economy by ignorant and selfish spirits has effected in confirming the worst tendencies of the commercial character yet is it not a first condition of our being able to substitute better machinery for the ordinary rules of self interest that we know scientifically how those rules do and must operate
the vital difference is that while the reactionary writer rigorously confines his faith within the region of facts accomplished the other anticipates a time when the endeavour of the best minds in the civilised world co operating with every favouring external circumstance that arises shall have in the international circle raised moral considerations to an ever higher and higher pre eminence and in internal conditions shall have left in the chances and training of the individual ever less and less excuse or grounds for a predisposition to anti social and barbaric moods
no writer shows himself more alive to the enormous moment to all europe of that transaction but we hear no word from him on the question whether we have more reason to bless or curse an event that interrupted either subsequently to retard or to accelerate the transformation of the west from a state of war of many degrees of social subordination of religious privilege of aristocratic administration into a state of peaceful industry of equal international rights of social equality of free and equal tolerance of creeds
eager for a firm foothold yet wholly revolted by the too narrow and unelevated positivity of the eighteenth century eager also for some recognition of the wide realm of the unknowable yet wholly unsatisfied by the transcendentalism of the english and scotch philosophic reactions he found in goethe that truly free and adequate positivity which accepts all things as parts of a natural or historic order and while insisting on the recognition of the actual conditions of this order as indispensable and condemning attempted evasions of such recognition as futile and childish yet opens an ample bosom for all forms of beauty in art and for all nobleness in moral aspiration
the questions involving controversies into which the society could not feel called to enter are treated at considerable length in the following pages

mr carlyle is as one who does not hear the question

it is not too much to say that nine out of ten people who think they have delivered themselves of a criticism when they call mr
in a third among men with strong practical energy to the benevolent bluster of a sort of christianity which is called muscular because it is not intellectual
his pages are the record of sentences passed not the presentation of human characters in all their fulness and colour and the consequence is that even now and so soon in spite of all their rhetorical brilliance their hold on men has grown slack
it does not neutralise the general lack of faith in the cultivable virtue of masses of men nor the universal tone of humoristic cynicism with which all but a little band the supposed salt of the earth are treated
14 even this however with the literal communion of saints which follows in connection with it is only a detached suggestion not incorporated with the body of the writer's doctrine
each bids us look within our own bosoms for truth and right postpones reason to feeling and refers to introspection and a factitious something styled nature questions only to be truly solved by external observation and history
every reader remembers the notable passage in which he declares that the question of protestant or not protestant meant everywhere is there anything of nobleness in you o nation or is there nothing
men who have long since moved far away from these spiritual latitudes like those who still find an adequate shelter in them can hardly help feeling as they turn the pages of the now disused pieces which they were once wont to ponder daily that whatever later teachers may have done in definitely shaping opinion in giving specific form to sentiment and in subjecting impulse to rational discipline here was the friendly fire bearer who first conveyed the promethean spark here the prophet who first smote the rock
a born poet only wanting perhaps a clearer feeling for form and a more delicate spiritual self possession to have added another name to the illustrious catalogue of english singers he has been driven by the impetuosity of his sympathies to attack the scientific side of social questions in an imaginative and highly emotional manner
it is easy to make a solitude and call it peace to plant an iron heel and call it order
impotent unrest however is followed in mr
mr carlyle's influence however was at its height before this idolatry of the soldier became a paramount article in his creed and it is devoutly to be hoped that not many of those whom he first taught to seize before all things fact and reality will follow him into this torrid air where only forces and never principles are facts and where nothing is reality but the violent triumph of arbitrarily imposed will
viewed from this point the manner of the achievement is as important as is its immediate product a consideration which it is one of mr
the theory of the reign of terror was invented and mercilessly reduced to practice by men whom the visions of rousseau had fired and who were not afraid nor ashamed to wade through oceans of blood to the promised land of humanity and fine feeling
carlyle never wearies of extolling and enjoining under the name of belief and the absence of it the inability to enter into it is that unbelief which he so bitterly vituperates or in another phrase that discontent which he charges with holding the soul in such desperate and paralysing bondage
nevertheless the most important question that we can ask of any great teacher as of the walk and conversation of any commonest person remains this how far has he strengthened and raised the conscious and harmonious dignity of humanity how stirred in men and women many or few deeper and more active sense of the worth and obligation and innumerable possibilities not of their own little lives one or another but of life collectively how heightened the self respect of the race
who knows but in unborn centuries paragueno men will look back to their lean iron francia as men do in such cases to the one veracious person and institute considerations
to the question whether mankind gained or lost by the french revolution mr
insight indeed goes far but it no more entitles its possessor to dispense with reasoned discipline and system in treating scientific subjects than it relieves him from the necessity of conforming to the physical conditions of health
it is a question of temperament which of the two mental attitudes becomes fixed and habitual as it is a question of temperament how violently either of them straitens and distorts the normal faculties of vision
no excess of morality we may be sure has followed this excessive adoption of the exclusively moral standard
17 it is impossible to overrate the truly supreme importance of the violent break up of europe which followed the death of the emperor charles vi
to bid a man do his duty in one page and then in the next to warn him sternly away from utilitarianism from political economy from all theories of the moral sense and from any other definite means of ascertaining what duty may chance to be is but a bald and naked counsel
has mr carlyle's passion or have the sedulous and scientific labours of that bentham whose name with him is a symbol of evil done most in what he calls the scoundrel province of reform within the last half century
carlyle's own writings in one sense he may be called mystic and transcendental in another baldly mechanical and even cold hearted just as novalis found goethe to be in _meister_
let us condemn error or immorality when the scope of our criticism calls for this particular function but why rush to praise or blame to eulogy or reprobation when we should do better simply to explore and enjoy
thus instead of co ordinating moral worthiness with intellectual energy virtue with intelligence right action of the will with scientific processes of the understanding he has either placed one immeasurably below the other or else has mischievously insisted on treating them as identical
rousseau notwithstanding the method of _emile_ treats man as a part of a collective whole contracting manifold relations and owing manifold duties and he always appeals to the love and sympathy which an imaginary god of nature has implanted in the heart
mr carlyle following the same method of obedience to his own personal emotions unfortified by patient reasoning lands at the other extremity and lays all his stress on the separatist instincts
questions of death and immortality origin of evil freedom and necessity are ever appearing and attempting to shape something of the universe

what seems to many of us the extreme inefficiency or worse of his solutions still allows us to feel grateful for the vigour and perspicacity with which he has pressed on the world the urgency of the problem
this however is emphatically a secondary aspect of his character and of the function which he has fulfilled in relation to the more active tendencies of modern opinion and feeling
the great man is the light which enlightens which has enlightened the darkness of the world a flowing light fountain in whose radiance all souls feel that it is well with them
the consequences have not been without their danger
it is curious to consider now he says once with what fierce deep breathed doggedness the poor english nation drawn by their instincts held fast upon it the spanish war of walpole's time in jenkins ear question and would take no denial of it as if they had surmised and seen
sense knows not faith knows not only that it is through mystery to mystery
who has not felt this to be one of the glories of mr
the one fuses or crystallises external objects and circumstances in the medium of human feeling and passion the other is concerned with the relations of objects and circumstances among themselves including in them all the facts of human consciousness and with the discovery and classification of these relations
against byronism the ordinary moralist and preacher could really do nothing because byronism was an appeal that lay in the regions of the mind only accessible by one with an eye and a large poetic feeling for the infinite whole of things
carlyle has written about a large number of men of all varieties of opinion and temperament and written with emphasis and point and strong feeling yet there is hardly one of these judgments however much we may dissent from it which we could fairly put a finger upon as indecently absurd or futile
it would be easy enough to find places where he talks of the dumb millions in terms of fine and sincere humanity and his feeling for the common pathos of the human lot as he encounters it in individual lives is as earnest and as simple as it is invariably lovely and touching in its expression
not the least conspicuous of the disciples of rousseau was robespierre
that mr carlyle has reached this high ground we do not say
yet have we not to confess that there is another side to this kind of truth in both these fields
not even comte himself has harder words for metaphysics than mr
it was this and not the massacre which was france's reply to the genius of fact and veracity
it was there probably that he acquired that sympathy with the past or with certain portions of the past that feeling of the unity of history and that conviction of the necessity of binding our theory of history fast with our theory of other things in all of which he so strikingly resembles the great anglican leaders of a generation ago and in gaining some of which so strenuous an effort must have been needed to modify the prepossessions of a scotch puritan education
as if there were nothing admirable in a man save unbroken obedience to the letter of the moral law and that letter read in our own casual and local interpretation and as if we had no faculties of sympathy no sense for the beauty of character no feeling for broad force and full pulsing vitality
it will lie not in more moral earnestness only but in a more open intelligence not merely in a more dogged resolution to work and be silent but in a ready willingness to use the understanding
but this was not so clear fifty years since when the crash and dust of demolition had not so subsided as to let men see how much had risen up behind
coleridge in fact was not only a poet but a thinker as well he had science of a sort as well as imagination but it was not science for headlong and impatient souls
carlyle the revolution begins not in 1789 but in 1741 not with the fall of the bastile but with the battle of mollwitz
this is not to say that he may not render us much help in those far more momentous problems which affect the guidance of our own lives
poetic persons have rushed in where scientific persons ought not to have feared to tread
in ages not of faith there will always be multitudinous troops of people crying for the moon
carlyle in his latest utterance is not intellectual dimness chiefly but torpid unveracity of heart

not knowing this we cannot accurately know its true tendency and direction
and that afterwards it fared with nations as they did or did not accept this sixteenth century form of truth when it came
in a word he is a prophet and not a philosopher and it is fruitless to go to him for help in the solution of philosophic problems
if the strength of prussia now proves that frederick had a right to seize silesia and relieves us from inquiring further whether he had any such right or not why then should not the royalist assume from the fact of the restoration and the consequent obliteration of cromwell's work that the protector was a usurper and a phantasm captain
sterling and i walked westward he says once arguing copiously but _except_ in opinion not disagreeing
this is the worst of an emotional teacher that people take only so much as they please from him while with a reasoner they must either refute by reason or else they must accept by reason and not at simple choice
may we not say further that the true renovation of england if such a process be ever feasible will lie in a quite other method than this of emotion
but how shall we know the wisest when we see them and how shall a nation know if not by keen respect and watchfulness for intellectual truth and the teachers of it

here is the limit of the true law of the relations between man and fate
circumstance has fixed limits that no effort can transcend
mr carlyle on the contrary falls back on the same reflection for comfort in the face of political confusions and difficulties and details which he has not the moral patience to encounter scientifically

he carries the process a step further giving back to the great man what had been taken for beings greater than any man and summoning us to trim the lamp of endeavour at the shrine of heroic chiefs of mankind
the vast waste which this limitation of prospect entails is the most grievous rejection of moral treasure if it be true that nothing enriches the nature like wide sympathy and many coloured appreciativeness
and at the moment while she writes nature down debtor to the conqueror may she not also have written her down his implacable creditor for the moral cost of his conquest
the gospel of the new was that the government of men and kingdoms is a business beyond all others demanding an open eyed accessibility to all facts and realities that here more than anywhere else you need to give the tools to him who can handle them that government does by no means go on of itself but more than anything else in this world demands skill patience energy long and tenacious grip and the constant presence of that most indispensable yet most rare of all practical convictions that the effect is the inevitable consequent of the cause
carlyle's strong individuality has precipitated in his written style may in spite of the poetic fineness of his imagination which no historian or humorist has excelled still be expected to deprive his work of that permanence which is only secured by classic form
carlyle holds all these vices as deeply in reprobation as if he had written ten thousand sermons against them but he leaves the fulmination to the hack moralist of the pulpit or the press with whom words are cheap easily gotten and readily thrown forth
it is good for us to build temples to great names which recall special transfigurations of humanity but it is better still it gives a firmer nerve to purpose and adds a finer holiness to the ethical sense to carry ever with us the unmarked yet living tradition of the voiceless unconscious effort of unnumbered millions of souls flitting lightly away like showers of thin leaves yet ever augmenting the elements of perfectness in man and exalting the eternal contest
it is still but an outline which may serve a present need and perhaps be of some assistance to a future biographer
to stop at the soldier and the gibbet and such order as they can furnish is to close the eyes to the entire problem of the future and we may be sure that what omits the future is no adequate nor stable solution of the present

carlyle's works may be taken for the final presentation of all that the author has to say to his contemporaries and to possess the settled form in which he wishes his words to go to those of posterity who may prove to have ears for them

the essence of morality is the subjugation of nature in obedience to social needs
carlyle goes back to something like the forms of feudalism for the model of the industrial organisation of the future but in the spiritual order he is as far removed as possible from any semblance of that revival of the old ecclesiastical forms without the old theological ideas which is the corner stone of comte's edifice

metaphysical speculation as it begins in no or nothingness so it must needs end in nothingness circulates and must circulate in endless vortices creating swallowing itself
the historian of the intellectual and moral movements of great britain during the present century will fail egregiously in his task if he omits to give a large and conspicuous space to the author of _sartor resartus_
carlyle nowhere gives a clear answer indeed on this subject more even than any other he clings closely to his favourite method of simple presentation streaked with dramatic irony
his genius gave him a right to mock at the ineffectiveness of dryasdust but his genius was also too true to prevent him from adding the always needful supplement of a painstaking industry that rivals dryasdust's own most strenuous toil
if you secretly or openly hold that to be just and veracious which is successful then it needs no further demonstration that penalties of ultimate failure are exacted for injustice because it is precisely the failure that constitutes the injustice

such an impression may inform the soul with a devout mingled sense of grandeur and nothingness or it may blacken into cynicism and antinomian living for self and the day

carlyle's cardinal book is perhaps as good a name as another for this two faced yet integral philosophy which teaches us to behold with cheerful serenity the great gulf which is fixed round our faculty and existence on every side while it fills us with that supreme sense of countless unseen possibilities and of the hidden undefined movements of shadow and light over the spirit without which the soul of man falls into hard and desolate sterility
to the minnow every cranny and pebble and quality and accident may have become familiar but does the minnow understand the ocean tides and periodic currents the trade winds and monsoons and moon's eclipses by all which the condition of its little creek is regulated and may from time to time _un_ miraculously enough be quite overset and reversed
carlyle's many gifts and highly as we may revere his character it is yet very doubtful whether anybody has as yet learnt from him the precious lesson of scrupulosity and conscientiousness in actively and constantly using the intelligence

be that as it may the carlylean view of the eighteenth century as a time of mere scepticism and unbelief is now clearly untenable to men who remember the fervour of jean jacques and the more rational but not any less fervid faith of the disciples of perfectibility
even however if we find that it has its excesses we may forgive much to the merits of a reaction against a system which has raised monstrous floods of sour cant round about us and hardened the hearts and parched the sympathies of men by blasts from theological deserts

nobody now we may suppose who is competent to judge thinks that that estimate of the net product of the tumultuous atheism of diderot and his fellow workers is a satisfactory account of the influence and significance of the encyclop忙dia nor that to sum up voltaire with his burning passion for justice his indefatigable humanity his splendid energy in intellectual production his righteous hatred of superstition as merely a supreme master of _persiflage_ can be a process partaking of finality
a man born into a community where political forms from the monarchy down to the popular chamber are mainly hollow shams disguising the coarse supremacy of wealth where religion is mainly official and political and is ever too ready to dissever itself alike from the spirit of justice the spirit of charity and the spirit of truth and where literature does not as a rule permit itself to discuss serious subjects frankly and worthily 4 a community in short where the great aim of all classes and orders with power is by dint of rigorous silence fast shutting of the eyes and stern stopping of the ears somehow to keep the social pyramid on its apex with the fatal result of preserving for england its glorious fame as a paradise for the well to do a purgatory for the able and a hell for the poor why a man born into all this with a heart something softer than a flint and with intellectual vision something more acute than that of a troglodyte may well be allowed to turn aside and cry for moons for a season

carlyle has initiated or accelerated and deepened though assuredly many years must elapse before any adequate measure can be taken of their force and final direction
it is eminently unreasonable to talk of france seeing good to end protestantism in a night when we reflect that twenty six years after the provisions of the edict of nantes were what they were
one of mr carlyle's chief and just glories is that for more than forty years he has clearly seen and kept constantly and conspicuously in his own sight and that of his readers the profoundly important crisis in the midst of which we are living
it is the supernaturalism which stirs men first until larger fulness of years and wider experience of life draw them to a wise and not inglorious acquiescence in naturalism
carlyle's case that he was born in the memorable year when the french revolution in its narrower sense was closed by the whiff of grape shot and when the great century of emancipation and illumination was ending darkly in battles and confusion

carlyle's teaching has been so extremely mis stated sinks wholly out of sight in connection with such heroes as the coarse and materialist bonaparte of whom however the hero worshipper in earlier pieces speaks with some laudable misgiving and the not less coarse and materialist frederick about whom no misgiving is permitted to the loyal disciple
how long they are likely to endure it would be rash to predict among a nation whose established teachers and official preachers are prevented by an inveterate timidity from trusting themselves to that disciplined intelligence in which the superior minds of the last century had such courageous faith
the fact that he should have taken no distinct side in the great debate as to revelation salvation inspiration and the other theological issues that agitate and divide a community where theology is now mostly verbal has been the subject of some comment and has had the effect of adding one rather peculiar side to the many varieties of his influence
carlyle like providence is always on the side of big and victorious battalions is the last outcome of a devotion to vigorous action and practical effect which no verbal garniture of a transcendental kind can hinder us from perceiving to be more purely materialist and unfeignedly brutal than anything which sprung from the reviled thought of the eighteenth century

that christianity became at last an instrument powerful enough to save civilisation
the familiar distinction between the poetic and the scientific temper is another way of stating the same difference
the great reactionist is a type that is wholly dark to him
if we look among our own countrymen we find that the apostle of self renunciation is nowhere so beloved as by the best of those whom steady self reliance and thrifty self securing and a firm eye to the main chance have got successfully on in the world
carlyle a pantheist could neither explain with any precision what pantheism is nor have ever thought of determining the parts of his writings where this particular monster is believed to lurk
even renunciation of self is in truth only the casting out of those disturbing and masterful qualities which oppress and hinder the free natural play of the worthier parts of character
it is decidedly natural that man in a state of nature should take and keep as much as his skill and physical strength enable him to do
spain was finally thrust from among the efficient elements in the european state system

153 the readiness to use general names in speaking of the greater subjects and the fitness which qualifies a man to use them commonly exist in inverse proportions
mr carlyle has probably never been able to endure a subdivision all his life and the infinite ramifications of the central division between object and subject might well be with him an unprofitable weariness to the flesh
the hideousness of the christian church in the ninth and tenth centuries was passed lightly over by men who had only eyes for the moral obliquity of the church of the encyclop忙dia

the fire of the new school had been taken from the very conflagration which they execrated but they were not held back from denouncing the eighteenth century by the reflection that at any rate its thought and action had made ready the way for much of what is best in the nineteenth
it is instructive to remark that another of the most illustrious enemies of that century and all its works joseph de maistre had the same admiration for the effectiveness of war and the same extreme interest and concern in the men and things of war
mr carlyle knows as well as macaulay how blind and stupid a creed was english toryism a century ago but he seizes and reproduces the character of his man and this was much more than a matter of a creed
a thorough appreciation of fiscal and economic truths was at least as indispensable for the life of the roman empire as the acceptance of a messiah and it was only in the hands of a great statesman like gregory vii
the magnitude of the universal forces enlarges the pettiness of man and the smallness of his achievement and endurance takes a complexion of greatness from the vague immensity that surrounds and impalpably mixes with it
take out of the mind of the english reader of ordinary cultivation and the average journalist usually a degree or two lower than this their conceptions of the french revolution and the english rebellion and their knowledge of german literature and history as well as most of their acquaintance with the prominent men of the eighteenth century and we shall see how much work mr
the vileness into which jesuitism eventually sank is a poor reason why we should malign and curse those who centuries before found in the rules and discipline and aims of that system an acceptable expression for their own disinterested social aspirations
devotion to the heroic does not prevent the assumption of a tone towards the great mass of the unheroic which implies that they are no more than two legged mill horses ever treading a fixed and unalterable round
the hoary and stupendous formations of the inorganic world the thousand tribes of insects the great universe of plants from those whose size and form and hue make us afraid as if they were deadly monsters down to the meanest flower that blows all these are clothed with one set of attributes by scientific intelligence and with another by sentiment fancy and imaginative association

it is one thing to judge a system in its corruption and a quite other thing to measure the worth and true design of its first founders one thing to estimate the intention and sincerity of a movement when it first stirred the hearts of men and another thing to pass sentence upon it in the days of its degradation
it was he as has been said who first taught england to appreciate goethe and not only to appreciate goethe but to recognise and seek yet further knowledge of the genius and industry of goethe's countrymen
his often enjoined silence is the first condition of this supreme kind of liberty for what is silence but the absence of a self tormenting assertiveness the freedom from excessive susceptibility under the speech of others one's removal from the choking sandy wilderness of wasted words
carlyle's teaching which first touches people because youth is the time of indefinite aspiration and it is easier besides to surrender ourselves passively to these vague emotional impressions than to apply actively and contentedly to the duty that lies nearest and to the securing of that infinitesimallest product on which the teacher is ever insisting
in other words the ultimate certainty of dissolution does not nullify the beauty and strength of physical life and the putrescence of jesuit methods and ideas is no more a reproach to those who first found succour in them than the cant and formalism of any other degenerate form of active faith say monachism or calvinism prove calvin or benedict or bernard to have been hypocritical and hollow

we know in what coarse outcome such an estimate of the dignity of other life than the life heroic has practically issued in what barbarous vindication of barbarous law breaking in jamaica in what inhuman softness for slavery in what contemptuous and angry words for beales and his 50,000 roughs contrasted with gentle words for our precious aristocracy with the politest and gracefullest kind of woman to wife

or were men thrown off the right track of improvement by a movement which turned exclusively on abstract rights which dealt with men's ideas and habits as if they were instantaneously pliable before the aspirations of any government and which by its violent and inconsiderate methods drove all these who should only have been friends of order into being the enemies of progress as well
two of their seven sons thomas and edward removed from portland to boston in 1802 and established themselves as partners in commercial business continuing united and prosperous for nearly half a century before the firm was dissolved
to the incorrigibly sentimental all this was sheer poison which continues tenaciously in the system
the doctrine has been very widely interpreted and without any forcing as a religious expression for the conditions of commercial success
are we really nearer to the permanent establishment of the new order for what was done between 1789 and 1793
the contentiousness of rival schools of philosophy has obscured the application of the same distinction to the various orders of fact more nearly and immediately relating to man and the social union
carlyle's manner partially veil the depth of this acquiescence which is really not so far removed from fatalism
the political side of the reverential sentiment is equally conciliated and the prime business of individuals and communities pronounced to be the search after worthy objects of this divine quality of reverence
as a reaction against religious theories which make humanity over abound in self consequence and fill individuals with the strutting importance of creatures with private souls to save or lose even such cynicism as byron's was wholesome and nearly forgivable
such names are by the vast majority even of persons who think themselves educated imperfectly apprehended ignorantly interpreted and crudely and recklessly applied
mr carlyle had fully as much daring as byron his writing at its best if without the many eyed minuteness and sustained pulsing force of byron has still the full swell and tide and energy of genius he is as lawless in his disrespect for some things established
many publicists and sentimental politicians are ever striving to conceal this displeasing fact from themselves and others and evading the lesson of the outbreaks that now and again convulse the civilised world
carlyle assures us of bonaparte that he had an instinct of nature better than his culture was and illustrates it by the story that during the egyptian expedition when his scientific men were busy arguing that there could be no god bonaparte looking up to the stars confuted them decisively by saying very ingenious messieurs but _who made_ all that
he has himself taught us to separate these two sides of a man and we have learnt from him to love samuel johnson without reading much or a word that the old sage wrote
two conspicuous qualities of carlylean doctrine flow from this fatalism or poetised utilitarianism or illumined positivity
there are many able and honest and republican men who in their hearts suspect that the latter of the two alternatives is the more correct description of what has happened
hopefulness and enthusiastic confidence in humanity when freed from the fetters of spiritual superstition and secular tyranny marked all the most characteristic and influential speculations of the two generations before 89
to a man like macaulay for example criticism was only a tribunal before which men were brought to be decisively tried by one or two inflexible tests and then sent to join the sheep on the one hand or the goats on the other

carlyle's method with him it is good to leave the mass and fall down before the individual and be saved by him
fatalism of this stamp is the natural and unavoidable issue of a born positivity of spirit uninformed by scientific meditation
the appalling failure which attended the splendid attempt to realise these hopes in a renewed and perfected social structure had no more than its natural effect in turning men's minds back not to the past of rousseau's imagination but to the past of recorded history
there are passages in which he speaks respectfully of intellect but he is always careful to show that he is using the term in a special sense of his own and confounding it with the exact summary of human _worth_ as in one place he defines it
a well known chapter in the _life of sterling_ which some indeed have found too ungracious shows how little hold he felt coleridge's ideas to be capable of retaining and how little permanent satisfaction resided in them
in england the greatest literary organ of the revolution was unquestionably byron whose genius daring and melodramatic lawlessness exercised what now seems such an amazing fascination over the least revolutionary of european nations
they seem to have seen these brave old northmen he says in one place what meditation has taught all men in all ages that this world is after all but a show a phenomenon or appearance no real thing
to refuse to use the intellect patiently and with system to decline to seek scientific truth to prefer effusive indulgence of emotion to the laborious and disciplined and candid exploration of new ideas is not this too a torpid unveracity
carlyle so often quotes as the sublime we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep
this the man who knows his own good cherishes in his inmost soul as a sacred thing an elixir of moral life
15 who knows indeed if only it prove that their lean iron francia in his passion for order and authority did not stamp out the very life of the nation
we in our days have seen the same result of sentimental doctrine in the barbarous love of the battle field the retrograde passion for methods of repression the contempt for human life the impatience of orderly and peaceful solution
unable to dream of swift renovation and wisdom among men he ponders on the unreality of life and hardens his heart against generations that will not know the things that pertain unto their peace
would it have been better if it had been possible for the old belief gradually as by process of nature to fall to pieces new doctrine as gradually and as normally emerging from the ground of disorganised and decayed convictions without any of that frightful violence which stirred men's deepest passions and gave them a sinister interest in holding one or other of the rival creeds in its most extreme exclusive and intolerant form
the instincts of sanctification rooted in teutonic races and which in the corrupt and unctuous forms of a mechanical religious profession are so revolting were mocked and outraged where they were not superciliously ignored in every line of the one while in the other they were enthroned under the name of worship as the very key and centre of the right life
again at the bottom of the veriest _frondeur_ with english blood in his veins in his most defiant moment there lies a conviction that after all something known as common sense is the measure of life and that to work hard is a demonstrated precept of common sense
no tenable theory about free will or necessity no theory of praise and blame that will bear positive tests lays us under any obligation to spare either the comfort or the life of a man who indulges in certain anti social kinds of conduct

of the reformation as of the french revolution philosophers have doubted how far it really contributed to the stable progress of european civilisation
vehement native force was too strong for such a man to remain in the luminous haze which made the coleridgean atmosphere
he is content to know that frederick made himself master of silesia without considering that the day of jena loomed in front
yet the consciousness of this made him none the less careful minute patient systematic in examining a policy or criticising a tax
6 _positive no english lexicon as yet seems to justify the use of this word in one of the senses of the french _positif_ as when a historian for instance speaks of the _esprit positif_ of bonaparte
carlyle himself says in a place where he talks of believing both in the french revolution and in frederick that is to say both that real kingship is eternally indispensable and also that the destruction of sham kingship a frightful process is occasionally so
it was not the rebellion only in _manfred_ nor the wit in _don juan_ nor the graceful melancholy of _childe harold_ which made their author an idol and still make him one to multitudes of frenchmen and germans and italians
carlyle urges upon us but the search for that mental freedom which under one name or another has been the goal and ideal of all highest minds that have reflected on the true constitution of human happiness
to him it seems better worth while having made sure of some sterling sincerity and rare genuineness of vision and singular human quality to dwell on and do justice to that than to accumulate commonplaces as to the viciousness of vice
it is none the less for what has just been said a weightier and a rarer privilege for a man to give a stirring impulse to the moral activity of a generation than to write in classic style and to have impressed the spirit of his own personality deeply upon the minds of multitudes of men than to have composed most of those works which the world is said not willingly to let die
nowhere has puritanism done us more harm than in thus leading us to take all breadth and colour and diversity and fine discrimination out of our judgments of men reducing them to thin narrow and superficial pronouncements upon the letter of their morality or the precise conformity of their opinions to accepted standards of truth religious or other
thirty or forty persons were slaughtered and many others were carried captive into canada
this has all the fundamental egotism of the doctrine of personal salvation emancipated from fable and varnished with an emotional phrase
carlyle's peculiar speculations without either doubting or failing to share that warm affection and reverence which his personality has worthily inspired in many thousands of his readers

for the instincts of simple guileless persons liable to be counted stupid by the unwary are sometimes of prophetic nature and spring from the deep places of this universe

occasional turgidity of phrase and unidiomatic handling of language do not conceal the simplicity of the process by which mr

he too declares that the loftiest and most generous sentiments are probably to be found in the soldier and that war if terrible is divine and splendid and fascinating the manifestation of a sublime law of the universe
the historian is pretty sure to be guided in his estimate of the forces which have contributed to dissolution in the past by the kind of anticipation which he entertains of the probable course of reconstruction
most of us would probably find the importance of this epoch in its destructive contribution rather than in that constructive and moral quality which lay under the movement of 89
the course of nature's phases on this our little fraction of a planet is partially known to us but who knows what deeper courses these depend on what infinitely larger cycle of causes our little epicycle revolves on
the difference between a reactionary and a truly progressive thinker or group of ideas is not that the one assumes virtuousness and morality as having been the conscious condition of international dealings while the other asserts that such dealings were the lawful consequence of self interest and the contest of material forces nor is it that the one insists on viewing international transactions from the same moral point which would be the right one if independent communities actually formed one stable and settled family while the other declines to view their morality at all
it is childish to say that the subsequent vileness is a proof of the existence of an inherent corrupt principle from the beginning because hitherto certainly and probably it will be so for ever even the most salutary movements and most effective social conceptions have been provisional
slumberous europe rotting amid its blind pedantries its lazy hypocrisies conscious and unconscious this man is capable of shaking it a little out of its stupid refuges of lies and ignominious wrappages and of intimating to it afar off that there is still a veracity in things and a mendacity in sham things and so forth in the well known strain

the most stirring general appeal to the emotions to be effective for more than negative purposes must lead up to definite maxims and specific precepts
mr carlyle has done much to wear this just and austere view into the minds of his generation and in so far he has performed an excellent service
the famous diatribe against jesuitism in the _latter day pamphlets_ 20 one of the most unfeignedly coarse and virulent bits of invective in the language points plumb in the same direction
we have simply got for our pains a most unlovely leanness of judgment and ever since the days when this temper set in until now when a wholesome rebellion is afoot it has steadily and powerfully tended to straiten character to make action mechanical and to impoverish art

carlyle's rendering human nature is not led for so long by lies and if it seems to be otherwise let us be sure that ideas which do lead and attract successive generations of men to self sacrifice and care for social interests must contain something which is not wholly a lie

in other words there is a difference between living in the history of literature or belief and living in literature itself and in the minds of believers
labour in a high spirit duty done and right service performed in fortitudinous temper here was not indeed a way out but a way of erect living within
carlyle's opinions and their worth as specific contributions very few people will be found to deny that his influence in stimulating moral energy in kindling enthusiasm for virtues worthy of enthusiasm and in stirring a sense of the reality on the one hand and the unreality on the other of all that man can do or suffer has not been surpassed by any teacher now living
john lothrop motley the second of these children was born in dorchester now a part of boston massachusetts on the 15th of april 1814

a hostile observer of bands of carlylites at oxford and elsewhere might have been justified in describing the imperative duty of work as the theme of many an hour of strenuous idleness and the superiority of golden silence over silver speech as the text of endless bursts of jerky rapture while a too constant invective against cant had its usual effect of developing cant with a difference

that with this sense of obligation to the master there mixes a less satisfactory reminiscence of youthful excess in imitative phrases in unseasonably apostolic readiness towards exhortation and rebuke in interest about the soul a portion of which might more profitably have been converted into care for the head is in most cases true
the highest souls are held to be deeply conscious of these vast unspeakable presences yet even with them they are only inspiring accessories the true interest lies in the practical attitude of such men towards the actual and palpable circumstances that surround them
with most men and women the master element in their opinions is obviously neither their own reason nor their own imagination independently exercised but only mere use and wont chequered by fortuitous sensations and modified in the better cases by the influence of a favourite teacher while in the worse the teacher is the favourite who happens to chime in most harmoniously with prepossessions or most effectually to nurse and exaggerate them

among other evils which it has inflicted this inability to conceive of conduct except as either right or wrong and correspondingly in the intellectual order of teaching except as either true or false is at the bottom of that fatal spirit of _parti pris_ which has led to the rooting of so much injustice disorder immobility and darkness in english intelligence

he was a great reader never idle but always had a book in his hand a volume of poetry or one of the novels of scott or cooper

in many of the characters in which some of the finest and most singular qualities of humanity would seem to have reached their furthest height their morality was the side least worth discussing
motley came to round hill as one of his schoolmates tells me with a great reputation especially as a declaimer
he had a remarkable facility for acquiring languages excelled as a reader and as a writer and was the object of general admiration for his many gifts
there is some reason to think that the flattery he received was for a time a hindrance to his progress and the development of his character
the majority of the ideas which constitute most men's intellectual stock in trade have accrued by processes quite distinct from fair reasoning and consequent conviction
he obtained praise too easily and learned to trust too much to his genius
he had everything to spoil him beauty precocious intelligence and a personal charm which might have made him a universal favorite
yet he does not seem to have been generally popular at this period of his life
yet we are never bidden either to strive or hope for a freedom that is unbounded
the difference between virtue and vice between wisdom and folly is only phenomenal yet there is difference enough
he was wilful impetuous sometimes supercilious always fastidious
he would study as he liked and not by rule
his school and college mates believed in his great possibilities through all his forming period but it may be doubted if those who counted most confidently on his future could have supposed that he would develop the heroic power of concentration the long breathed tenacity of purpose which in after years gave effect to his brilliant mental endowments
here was a revolution we cannot doubt

such then was the boy who at the immature we might almost say the tender age of thirteen entered harvard college
though two years after me in college standing i remember the boyish reputation which he brought with him especially that of a wonderful linguist and the impression which his striking personal beauty produced upon us as he took his seat in the college chapel
but it was not until long after this period that i became intimately acquainted with him and i must again have recourse to the classmates and friends who have favored me with their reminiscences of this period of his life

mr phillips says during our first year in college though the youngest in the class he stood third i think or second in college rank and ours was an especially able class
yet to maintain this rank he neither cared nor needed to make any effort
nor is denunciation of the conditions of a problem the quickest step towards solving it
too young to feel any responsibilities and not yet awake to any ambition he became so negligent that he was rusticated that is sent away from college for a time
in connection with each of them has been exemplified the cruelty inherent in sentimentalism when circumstances draw away the mask
he came back sobered and worked rather more but with no effort for college rank thenceforward
i must finish the portrait of the collegian with all its lights and shadows by the help of the same friends from whom i have borrowed the preceding outlines
what _shadows we are and what shadows we pursue
he did not care to make acquaintances was haughty in manner and cynical in mood at least as he appeared to those in whom he felt no special interest
the manner of the partition was an outrage on moral conditions for which each of the nations that profited by it paid in the lawlessness of bonaparte
it is no wonder therefore that he was not a popular favorite although recognized as having very brilliant qualities
during all this period his mind was doubtless fermenting with projects which kept him in a fevered and irritable condition
the incorporation of so many phrases allusions nicknames that belong only to the hour inevitably makes the vitality of the composition conditional on the vitality of these transient and accidental elements which are so deeply imbedded in it
he had a small writing table mr
phillips says with a shallow drawer i have often seen it half full of sketches unfinished poems soliloquies a scene or two of a play prose portraits of some pet character etc
these he would read to me though he never volunteered to do so and every now and then he burnt the whole and began to fill the drawer again
my friend mr john osborne sargent who was a year before him in college says in a very interesting letter with which he has favored me my first acquaintance with him motley was at cambridge when he came from mr
cogswell's school at round hill
he then had a good deal of the shyness that was just pronounced enough to make him interesting and which did not entirely wear off till he left college
france was left weak impoverished humiliated
i soon became acquainted with him and we used to take long walks together sometimes taxing each other's memory for poems or passages from poems that had struck our fancy
why was the blow struck by the directory on the eighteenth fructidor a blunder and that struck by bonaparte on the eighteenth brumaire a veracity
shelley was then a great favorite of his and i remember that praed's verses then appearing in the new monthly he thought very clever and brilliant and was fond of repeating them
you have forgotten or perhaps never knew that motley's first appearance in print was in the collegian
he brought me one day in a very modest mood a translation from goethe which i was most happy to oblige him by inserting
it was very prettily done and will now be a curiosity
how it happened that motley wrote only one piece i do not remember
i had the pleasure about that time of initiating him as a member of the knights of the square table always my favorite college club for the reason perhaps that i was a sometime grand master
he was always a genial and jovial companion at our supper parties at fresh pond and gallagher's
we who live in the days of photographs know how many faces belong to every individual
what the moral renovation of rousseau did for france we all know
we know too under what different aspects the same character appears to those who study it from different points of view and with different prepossessions
there is a vast difference between this and the absolutism of the mystic
in spite of his passion for order he cannot understand the political point of view
i do not hesitate therefore to place side by side the impressions of two of his classmates as to one of his personal traits as they observed him at this period of his youth
he was a manly boy with no love for or leaning to girls company no care for dress not a trace of personal vanity
he was or at least seemed wholly unconscious of his rare beauty and of the fascination of his manner not a trace of pretence the simplest and most natural creature in the world
look on that picture and on this he seemed to have a passion for dress
but as in everything else so in this his fancy was a fitful one
at one time he would excite our admiration by the splendor of his outfit and perhaps the next week he would seem to take equal pleasure in his slovenly or careless appearance
it is not very difficult to reconcile these two portraitures
i recollect it was said by a witty lady of a handsome clergyman well remembered among us that he had dressy eyes
motley so well became everything he wore that if he had sprung from his bed and slipped his clothes on at an alarm of fire his costume would have looked like a prince's undress
his natural presentment like that of count d'orsay was of the kind which suggests the intentional effects of an elaborate toilet no matter how little thought or care may have been given to make it effective
the eternities and immensities are only a kind of awful background
i think the passion for dress was really only a seeming and that he often excited admiration when he had not taken half the pains to adorn himself that many a youth less favored by nature has wasted upon his unblest exterior only to be laughed at
and this is really the kernel of the carlylean doctrine
he has taken the end for the ratification or proscription of the means and stamped it as the verdict of fate and fact on the transaction and its doer
i gather some other interesting facts from a letter which i have received from his early playmate and school and college classmate mr
t g appleton in his sophomore year he kept abreast of the prescribed studies but his heart was out of bounds as it often had been at round hill when chasing squirrels or rabbits through forbidden forests
already his historical interest was shaping his life
a tutor coming by chance let us hope to his room remonstrated with him upon the heaps of novels upon his table
yes said motley i am reading historically and have come to the novels of the nineteenth century
taken in the lump they are very hard reading
the torrent of his eloquence bright and rushing as it is flows between rigid banks and over hard rocks
all old cambridge people know the brattle house with its gambrel roof its tall trees its perennial spring its legendary fame of good fare and hospitable board in the days of the kindly old bon vivant major brattle
in this house the two young students appleton and motley lived during a part of their college course
motley's room was on the ground floor the room to the left of the entrance
he led a very pleasant life there tempering his college duties with the literature he loved and receiving his friends amidst elegant surroundings which added to the charm of his society
occasionally we amused ourselves by writing for the magazines and papers of the day
mr willis had just started a slim monthly written chiefly by himself but with the true magazine flavor
we wrote for that and sometimes verses in the corner of a paper called the anti masonic mirror and in which corner was a woodcut of apollo and inviting to destruction ambitious youths by the legend underneath much yet remains unsung
these pieces were usually dictated to each other the poet recumbent upon the bed and a classmate ready to carry off the manuscript for the paper of the following day
blackwood's was then in its glory its pages redolent of mountain dew in every sense the humor of the shepherd the elegantly brutal onslaughts upon whigs and cockney poets by christopher north intoxicated us youths
it was young writing and made for the young
the opinions were charmingly wrong and its enthusiasm was half glenlivet
there were no reprints then and to pass the paper cutter up the fresh inviting pages was like swinging over the heather arm in arm with christopher himself
it is a little singular that though we had a college magazine of our own motley rarely if ever wrote for it
i remember a translation from goethe the ghost seer which he may have written for it and a poem upon the white mountains
motley spoke at one of the college exhibitions an essay on goethe so excellent that mr
joseph cogswell sent it to madam goethe who after reading it said i wish to see the first book that young man will write
although motley did not aim at or attain a high college rank the rules of the phi beta kappa society which confine the number of members to the first sixteen of each class were stretched so as to include him a tribute to his recognized ability and an evidence that a distinguished future was anticipated for him
his aim is unity

of the two years divided between the universities of berlin and gottingen i have little to record
that he studied hard i cannot doubt that he found himself in pleasant social relations with some of his fellow students seems probable from the portraits he has drawn in his first story morton's hope and is rendered certain so far as one of his companions is concerned
among the records of the past to which he referred during his last visit to this country was a letter which he took from a collection of papers and handed me to read one day when i was visiting him
the letter was written in a very lively and exceedingly familiar vein
it implied such intimacy and called up in such a lively way the gay times motley and himself had had together in their youthful days that i was puzzled to guess who could have addressed him from germany in that easy and off hand fashion
i knew most of his old friends who would be likely to call him by his baptismal name in its most colloquial form and exhausted my stock of guesses unsuccessfully before looking at the signature
i confess that i was surprised after laughing at the hearty and almost boyish tone of the letter to read at the bottom of the page the signature of bismarck
detesting jesuitism from the bottom of his soul he has been too willing to accept its fundamental maxim that the end justifies the means
i will not say that i suspect motley of having drawn the portrait of his friend in one of the characters of morton's hope but it is not hard to point out traits in one of them which we can believe may have belonged to the great chancellor at an earlier period of life than that at which the world contemplates his overshadowing proportions
hoping to learn something of motley during the two years while we had lost sight of him i addressed a letter to his highness prince bismarck to which i received the following reply foreign office berlin march 11 1878

he kept company with german students though more addicted to study than we members of the fighting clubs corps
although not having mastered yet the german language he exercised a marked attraction by a conversation sparkling with wit humor and originality

161 friedrich strasse there we lived in the closest intimacy sharing meals and outdoor exercise
motley by that time had arrived at talking german fluently he occupied himself not only in translating goethe's poem faust but tried his hand even in composing german verses
enthusiastic admirer of shakespeare byron goethe he used to spice his conversation abundantly with quotations from these his favorite authors
a pertinacious arguer so much so that sometimes he watched my awakening in order to continue a discussion on some topic of science poetry or practical life cut short by the chime of the small hours he never lost his mild and amiable temper
our faithful companion was count alexander keyserling a native of courland who has since achieved distinction as a botanist
a distinct and separate idea of this particular characteristic is indispensable
motley having entered the diplomatic service of his country we had frequently the opportunity of renewing our friendly intercourse at frankfort he used to stay with me the welcome guest of my wife we also met at vienna and later here
the last time i saw him was in 1872 at varzin at the celebration of my silver wedding namely the twenty fifth anniversary
the most striking feature of his handsome and delicate appearance was uncommonly large and beautiful eyes
he never entered a drawing room without exciting the curiosity and sympathy of the ladies
it is but a glimpse of their young life which the great statesman gives us but a bright and pleasing one
here were three students one of whom was to range in the flowery fields of the loveliest of the sciences another to make the dead past live over again in his burning pages and a third to extend an empire as the botanist spread out a plant and the historian laid open a manuscript
the empire was thoroughly shattered

20 25 return to america
study of law marriage
his first novel morton's hope
of the years passed in the study of law after his return from germany i have very little recollection and nothing of importance to record
he never became seriously engaged in the practice of the profession he had chosen
i had known him pleasantly rather than intimately and our different callings tended to separate us
i met him however not very rarely at one house where we were both received with the greatest cordiality and where the attractions brought together many both young and old to enjoy the society of its charming and brilliant inmates
this was at no
14 temple place where mr
park benjamin was then living with his two sisters both in the bloom of young womanhood
here motley found the wife to whom his life owed so much of its success and its happiness
those who remember mary benjamin find it hard to speak of her in the common terms of praise which they award to the good and the lovely
she was not only handsome and amiable and agreeable but there was a cordial frankness an openhearted sincerity about her which made her seem like a sister to those who could help becoming her lovers
she stands quite apart in the memory of the friends who knew her best even from the circle of young persons whose recollections they most cherish
yet hardly could one of them have foreseen all that she was to be to him whose life she was to share
they were married on the 2d of march 1837
his intimate friend mr
joseph lewis stackpole was married at about the same time to her sister thus joining still more closely in friendship the two young men who were already like brothers in their mutual affection
two years after his marriage in 1839 appeared his first work a novel in two volumes called morton's hope
he had little reason to be gratified with its reception
the general verdict was not favorable to it and the leading critical journal of america not usually harsh or cynical in its treatment of native authorship did not even give it a place among its critical notices but dropped a small print extinguisher upon it in one of the pages of its list of new publications
nothing could be more utterly disheartening than the unqualified condemnation passed upon the story
at the same time the critic says that no one can read morton's hope without perceiving it to have been written by a person of uncommon resources of mind and scholarship
it must be confessed that as a story morton's hope cannot endure a searching or even a moderately careful criticism
it is wanting in cohesion in character even in a proper regard to circumstances of time and place it is a map of dissected incidents which has been flung out of its box and has arranged itself without the least regard to chronology or geography
it is not difficult to trace in it many of the influences which had helped in forming or deforming the mind of the young man of twenty five not yet come into possession of his full inheritance of the slowly ripening qualities which were yet to assert their robust independence
how could he help admiring byron and falling into more or less unconscious imitation of his moods if not of his special affectations
passion showing itself off against a dark foil of cynicism sentiment ashamed of its own self betrayal and sneering at itself from time to time for fear of the laugh of the world at its sincerity how many young men were spoiled and how many more injured by becoming bad copies of a bad ideal
the blood of don juan ran in the veins of vivian grey and of pelham
but if we read the fantastic dreams of disraeli the intellectual dandyisms of bulwer remembering the after careers of which these were the preludes we can understand how there might well be something in those earlier efforts which would betray itself in the way of thought and in the style of the young men who read them during the plastic period of their minds and characters
allow for all these influences allow for whatever impressions his german residence and his familiarity with german literature had produced accept the fact that the story is to the last degree disjointed improbable impossible lay it aside as a complete failure in what it attempted to be and read it as vivian grey is now read in the light of the career which it heralded
morton's hope is not to be read as a novel it is to be studied as an autobiography a prophecy a record of aspirations disguised under a series of incidents which are flung together with no more regard to the unities than a pack of shuffled playing cards
i can do nothing better than let him picture himself for it is impossible not to recognize the portrait
it is of little consequence whether every trait is an exact copy from his own features but it is so obvious that many of the lines are direct transcripts from nature that we may believe the same thing of many others
let us compare his fictitious hero's story with what we have read of his own life
in early boyhood morton amused himself and astonished those about him by enacting plays for a puppet theatre
this was at six years old and at twelve we find him acting in a play with other boys just as motley's playmates have already described him
the hero may now speak for himself but we shall all perceive that we are listening to the writer's own story
i was always a huge reader my mind was essentially craving and insatiable
its appetite was enormous and it devoured too greedily for health
i rejected all guidance in my studies
i already fancied myself a misanthrope
i had taken a step very common for boys of my age and strove with all my might to be a cynic
he goes on to describe under the perfectly transparent mask of his hero the course of his studies
to poetry like most infants i devoted most of my time
from modern poetry he went back to the earlier sources first with the idea of systematic reading and at last through chaucer and gower and early ballads until he lost himself in a dismal swamp of barbarous romances and lying latin chronicles
i got hold of the bibliotheca monastica containing a copious account of anglo norman authors with notices of their works and set seriously to reading every one of them
one profit of his antiquarianism however was as he says his attention to foreign languages french spanish german especially in their earliest and rudest forms of literature
from these he ascended to the ancient poets and from latin to greek
he would have taken up the study of the oriental languages but for the advice of a relative who begged him seriously to turn his attention to history
the paragraph which follows must speak for itself as a true record under a feigned heading
the groundwork of my early character was plasticity and fickleness
i was mortified by this exposure of my ignorance and disgusted with my former course of reading
i now set myself violently to the study of history
with my turn of mind and with the preposterous habits which i had been daily acquiring i could not fail to make as gross mistakes in the pursuit of this as of other branches of knowledge
i imagined on setting out a system of strict and impartial investigation of the sources of history
i was inspired with the absurd ambition not uncommon to youthful students of knowing as much as their masters
i imagined it necessary for me stripling as i was to study the authorities and imbued with the strict necessity of judging for myself i turned from the limpid pages of the modern historians to the notes and authorities at the bottom of the page
these of course sent me back to my monastic acquaintances and i again found myself in such congenial company to a youthful and ardent mind as florence of worcester and simeon of durham the venerable bede and matthew paris and so on to gregory and fredegarius down to the more modern and elegant pages of froissart hollinshed hooker and stowe
infant as i was i presumed to grapple with masses of learning almost beyond the strength of the giants of history
a spendthrift of my time and labor i went out of my way to collect materials and to build for myself when i should have known that older and abler architects had already appropriated all that was worth preserving that the edifice was built the quarry exhausted and that i was consequently only delving amidst rubbish
this course of study was not absolutely without its advantages
the mind gained a certain proportion of vigor even by this exercise of its faculties just as my bodily health would have been improved by transporting the refuse ore of a mine from one pit to another instead of coining the ingots which lay heaped before my eyes
still however my time was squandered
there was a constant want of fitness and concentration of my energies
my dreams of education were boundless brilliant indefinite but alas
they were only dreams
there was nothing accurate and defined in my future course of life
i was ambitious and conceited but my aspirations were vague and shapeless
2 but this is slightly vague
i had crowded together the most gorgeous and even some of the most useful and durable materials for my woof but i had no pattern and consequently never began to weave
i had not made the discovery that an individual cannot learn nor be everything that the world is a factory in which each individual must perform his portion of work happy enough if he can choose it according to his taste and talent but must renounce the desire of observing or superintending the whole operation
from studying and investigating the sources of history with my own eyes i went a step further i refused the guidance of modern writers and proceeding from one point of presumption to another i came to the magnanimous conviction that i could not know history as i ought to know it unless i wrote it for myself
it would be tedious and useless to enlarge upon my various attempts and various failures
i forbear to comment upon mistakes which i was in time wise enough to retrieve
pushing out as i did without compass and without experience on the boundless ocean of learning what could i expect but an utter and a hopeless shipwreck
thus i went on becoming more learned and therefore more ignorant more confused in my brain and more awkward in my habits from day to day
the most fatal of confusions
i was ever at my studies and could hardly be prevailed upon to allot a moment to exercise or recreation
i breakfasted with a pen behind my ear and dined in company with a folio bigger than the table
i became solitary and morose the necessary consequence of reckless study talked impatiently of the value of my time and the immensity of my labors spoke contemptuously of the learning and acquirements of the whole world and threw out mysterious hints of the magnitude and importance of my own project
in the midst of all this study and this infant authorship the perusal of such masses of poetry could not fail to produce their effect
of a youth whose mind like mine at that period possessed some general capability without perhaps a single prominent and marked talent a proneness to imitation is sure to be the besetting sin
i consequently for a large portion of my earlier life never read a work which struck my fancy without planning a better one upon its model for my ambition like my vanity knew no bounds
it was a matter of course that i should be attacked by the poetic mania
i took the infection at the usual time went through its various stages and recovered as soon as could be expected
i discovered soon enough that emulation is not capability and he is fortunate to whom is soonest revealed the relative extent of his ambition and his powers
my ambition was boundless my dreams of glory were not confined to authorship and literature alone but every sphere in which the intellect of man exerts itself revolved in a blaze of light before me
and there i sat in my solitude and dreamed such wondrous dreams
events were thickening around me which were soon to change the world but they were unmarked by me
the country was changing to a mighty theatre on whose stage those who were as great as i fancied myself to be were to enact a stupendous drama in which i had no part
i saw it not i knew it not and yet how infinitely beautiful were the imaginations of my solitude
fancy shook her kaleidoscope each moment as chance directed and lo
what new fantastic brilliant but what unmeaning visions
my ambitious anticipations were as boundless as they were various and conflicting
there was not a path which leads to glory in which i was not destined to gather laurels
as a warrior i would conquer and overrun the world
as a statesman i would reorganize and govern it
as a historian i would consign it all to immortality and in my leisure moments i would be a great poet and a man of the world
in short i was already enrolled in that large category of what are called young men of genius men who are the pride of their sisters and the glory of their grandmothers men of whom unheard of things are expected till after long preparation comes a portentous failure and then they are forgotten subsiding into indifferent apprentices and attorneys clerks
alas for the golden imaginations of our youth
they are bright and beautiful but they fade
they glitter brightly enough to deceive the wisest and most cautious and we garner them up in the most secret caskets of our hearts but are they not like the coins which the dervise gave the merchant in the story
when we look for them the next morning do we not find them withered leaves
the ideal picture just drawn is only a fuller portraiture of the youth whose outlines have been already sketched by the companions of his earlier years
if his hero says i breakfasted with a pen behind my ear and dined in company with a folio bigger than the table one of his family says of the boy motley that if there were five minutes before dinner when he came into the parlor he always took up some book near at hand and began to read until dinner was announced
the same unbounded thirst for knowledge the same history of various attempts and various failures the same ambition not yet fixed in its aim but showing itself in restless effort belong to the hero of the story and its narrator
let no man despise the first efforts of immature genius
nothing can be more crude as a novel nothing more disappointing than morton's hope
but in no other of motley's writings do we get such an inside view of his character with its varied impulses its capricious appetites its unregulated forces its impatient grasp for all kinds of knowledge
with all his university experiences at home and abroad it might be said with a large measure of truth that he was a self educated man as he had been a self taught boy
his instincts were too powerful to let him work quietly in the common round of school and college training
looking at him as his companions describe him as he delineates himself mutato nomine the chances of success would have seemed to all but truly prophetic eyes very doubtful if not decidedly against him
too many brilliant young novel readers and lovers of poetry excused by their admirers for their shortcomings on the strength of their supposed birthright of genius have ended where they began flattered into the vain belief that they were men at eighteen or twenty and finding out at fifty that they were and always had been nothing more than boys
it was but a tangled skein of life that motley's book showed us at twenty five and older men might well have doubted whether it would ever be wound off in any continuous thread
to repeat his own words he had crowded together the materials for his work but he had no pattern and consequently never began to weave
the more this first work of motley's is examined the more are its faults as a story and its interest as a self revelation made manifest to the reader
the future historian who spared no pains to be accurate falls into the most extraordinary anachronisms in almost every chapter
carlyle's doctrine about nature's registration of the penalties of injustice is intrinsically an anachronism
brutus in a bob wig othello in a swallow tail coat could hardly be more incongruously equipped than some of his characters in the manner of thought the phrases the way of bearing themselves which belong to them in the tale but never could have belonged to characters of our revolutionary period
he goes so far in his carelessness as to mix up dates in such a way as almost to convince us that he never looked over his own manuscript or proofs
269 274 france for example is the conspicuous proof of what overtook the deniers
his hero is in prague in june 1777 reading a letter received from america in less than a fortnight from the date of its being written in august of the same year he is in the american camp where he is found in the company of a certain colonel waldron an officer of some standing in the revolutionary army with whom he is said to have been constantly associated for some three months having arrived in america as he says on the 15th of may that is to say six weeks or more before he sailed according to his previous account
bohemia seems to have bewitched his chronology as it did shakespeare's geography
to have made his story a consistent series of contradictions morton should have sailed from that bohemian seashore which may be found in a winter's tale but not in the map of europe
and yet in the midst of all these marks of haste and negligence here and there the philosophical student of history betrays himself the ideal of noble achievement glows in an eloquent paragraph or is embodied in a loving portrait like that of the professor and historian harlem
the novel taken in connection with the subsequent developments of the writer's mind is a study of singular interest
it is a chaos before the creative epoch the light has not been divided from the darkness the firmament has not yet divided the waters from the waters
the forces at work in a human intelligence to bring harmony out of its discordant movements are as mysterious as miraculous we might truly say as those which give shape and order to the confused materials out of which habitable worlds are evolved
it is too late now to be sensitive over this unsuccessful attempt as a story and unconscious success as a self portraiture
the first sketches of paul veronese the first patterns of the gobelin tapestry are not to be criticised for the sake of pointing out their inevitable and too manifest imperfections
they are to be carefully studied as the earliest efforts of the hand which painted the marriage at cana of the art which taught the rude fabrics made to be trodden under foot to rival the glowing canvas of the great painters
none of motley's subsequent writings give such an insight into his character and mental history
it took many years to train the as yet undisciplined powers into orderly obedience and to bring the unarranged materials into the organic connection which was needed in the construction of a work that should endure
there was a long interval between his early manhood and the middle term of life during which the slow process of evolution was going on
that this process was going on prior to 1789 is undeniable
there are plants which open their flowers with the first rays of the sun there are others that wait until evening to spread their petals
it was already the high noon of life with him before his genius had truly shown itself if he had not lived beyond this period he would have left nothing to give him a lasting name
27 28 first diplomatic appointment secretary of legation to the russian mission
brief residence at st
petersburg letter to his mother
return in the autumn of 1841 mr
motley received the appointment of secretary of legation to the russian mission mr
arriving at st petersburg just at the beginning of winter he found the climate acting very unfavorably upon his spirits if not upon his health and was unwilling that his wife and his two young children should be exposed to its rigors
the expense of living also was out of proportion to his income and his letters show that he had hardly established himself in st
petersburg before he had made up his mind to leave a place where he found he had nothing to do and little to enjoy
he was homesick too as a young husband and father with an affectionate nature like his ought to have been under these circumstances
he did not regret having made the experiment for he knew that he should not have been satisfied with himself if he had not made it
it was his first trial of a career in which he contemplated embarking and in which afterwards he had an eventful experience
in his private letters to his family many of which i have had the privilege of looking over he mentions in detail all the reasons which influenced him in forming his own opinion about the expediency of a continued residence at st
petersburg and leaves the decision to her in whose judgment he always had the greatest confidence
no unpleasant circumstance attended his resignation of his secretaryship and though it must have been a disappointment to find that the place did not suit him as he and his family were then situated it was only at the worst an experiment fairly tried and not proving satisfactory
he left st petersburg after a few months residence and returned to america
on reaching new york he was met by the sad tidings of the death of his first born child a boy of great promise who had called out all the affections of his ardent nature
it was long before he recovered from the shock of this great affliction
the boy had shown a very quick and bright intelligence and his father often betrayed a pride in his gifts and graces which he never for a moment made apparent in regard to his own
among the letters which he wrote from st
petersburg are two miniature ones directed to this little boy
his affectionate disposition shows itself very sweetly in these touching mementos of a love of which his first great sorrow was so soon to be born
not less charming are his letters to his mother showing the tenderness with which he always regarded her and full of all the details which he thought would entertain one to whom all that related to her children was always interesting
of the letters to his wife it is needless to say more than that they always show the depth of the love he bore her and the absolute trust he placed in her consulting her at all times as his nearest and wisest friend and adviser one in all respects fitted to warn to comfort and command
i extract a passage from one of his letters to his mother as much for the sake of lending a character of reality to his brief residence at st
petersburg as for that of the pleasant picture it gives us of an interior in that northern capital
we entered through a small vestibule with the usual arrangement of treble doors padded with leather to exclude the cold and guarded by two proud young porters in severe cocked hats and formidable batons into a broad hall threw off our furred boots and cloaks ascended a carpeted marble staircase in every angle of which stood a statuesque footman in gaudy coat and unblemished unmentionables and reached a broad landing upon the top thronged as usual with servants
thence we passed through an antechamber into a long high brilliantly lighted saffron papered room in which a dozen card tables were arranged and thence into the receiving room
this was a large room with a splendidly inlaid and polished floor the walls covered with crimson satin the cornices heavily incrusted with gold and the ceiling beautifully painted in arabesque
the massive fauteuils and sofas as also the drapery were of crimson satin with a profusion of gilding
the ubiquitous portrait of the emperor was the only picture and was the same you see everywhere
this crimson room had two doors upon the side facing the three windows the innermost opened into a large supper room in which a table was spread covered with the usual refreshments of european parties tea ices lemonade and et ceteras and the other opened into a ball room which is a sort of miniature of the salle blanche of the winter palace being white and gold and very brilliantly lighted with ormolu chandeliers filled with myriads of candles
this room at least forty feet long by perhaps twenty five opened into a carpeted conservatory of about the same size filled with orange trees and japonica plants covered with fruit and flowers arranged very gracefully into arbors with luxurious seats under the pendent boughs and with here and there a pretty marble statue gleaming through the green and glossy leaves
one might almost have imagined one's self in the land of the cypress and myrtle instead of our actual whereabout upon the polar banks of the neva
wandering through these mimic groves or reposing from the fatigues of the dance was many a fair and graceful form while the brilliantly lighted ballroom filled with hundreds of exquisitely dressed women for the russian ladies if not very pretty are graceful and make admirable toilettes formed a dazzling contrast with the tempered light of the winter garden
the conservatory opened into a library and from the library you reach the antechamber thus completing the giro of one of the prettiest houses in st
petersburg i waltzed one waltz and quadrilled one quadrille but it was hard work and as the sole occupation of these parties is dancing and card playing conversation apparently not being customary they are to me not very attractive
he could not be happy alone and there were good reasons against his being joined by his wife and children
with my reserved habits he says it would take a great deal longer to become intimate here than to thaw the baltic
i have only to knock that it shall be opened to me but that is just what i hate to do
man delights not me no nor woman neither
disappointed in his expectations but happy in the thought of meeting his wife and children he came back to his household to find it clad in mourning for the loss of its first born

letter to park benjamin
political views and feelings
a letter to mr
park benjamin dated december 17 1844 which has been kindly lent me by mrs
mary lanman douw of poughkeepsie gives a very complete and spirited account of himself at this period
he begins with a quiet but tender reference to the death of his younger brother preble one of the most beautiful youths seen or remembered among us a great favorite as he says in the family and in deed with every one who knew him
he mentions the fact that his friends and near connections the stackpoles are in washington which place he considers as exceptionally odious at the time when he is writing
the election of mr
polk as the opponent of henry clay gives him a discouraged feeling about our institutions
the question he thinks is now settled that a statesman can never again be called to administer the government of the country
he is almost if not quite in despair because it is now proved that a man take him for all in all better qualified by intellectual power energy and purity of character knowledge of men a great combination of personal qualities a frank high spirited manly bearing keen sense of honor the power of attracting and winning men united with a vast experience in affairs such as no man but john quincy adams now living has had and no man in this country can ever have again i say it is proved that a man better qualified by an extraordinary combination of advantages to administer the government than any man now living or any man we can ever produce again can be beaten by anybody
it has taken forty years of public life to prepare such a man for the presidency and the result is that he can be beaten by anybody mr
polk is anybody he is mr
quelconque i do not venture to quote the most burning sentences of this impassioned letter
carlyle's definition of the just and the unjust are such as to reduce this and all his other sentences of like purport to the level of mere truism and repetition
it shows that motley had not only become interested most profoundly in the general movements of parties but that he had followed the course of political events which resulted in the election of mr
polk with careful study and that he was already looking forward to the revolt of the slave states which occurred sixteen years later
the letter is full of fiery eloquence now and then extravagant and even violent in expression but throbbing with a generous heat which shows the excitable spirit of a man who wishes to be proud of his country and does not wish to keep his temper when its acts make him ashamed of it
he is disgusted and indignant to the last degree at seeing mr
quelconque chosen over the illustrious statesman who was his favorite candidate
but all his indignation cannot repress a sense of humor which was one of his marked characteristics
after fatiguing his vocabulary with hard usage after his unsparing denunciation of the very dirty politics which he finds mixed up with our popular institutions he says it must be remembered that this was an offhand letter to one nearly connected with him all these things must in short to use the energetic language of the balm of columbia advertisement bring every generous thinking youth to that heavy sinking gloom which not even the loss of property can produce but only the loss of hair which brings on premature decay causing many to shrink from being uncovered and even to shun society to avoid the jests and sneers of their acquaintances
the remainder of their lives is consequently spent in retirement
he continues before dropping the subject and to show the perfect purity of my motives i will add that i am not at all anxious about the legislation of the new government
carlyle's doctrine was perfect
i desired the election of clay as a moral triumph and because the administration of the country at this moment of ten thousand times more importance than its legislation would have been placed in pure strong and determined hands
then comes a dash of that satirical and somewhat cynical way of feeling which he had not as yet outgrown
he had been speaking about the general want of attachment to the union and the absence of the sentiment of loyalty as bearing on the probable dissolution of the union
i don't mean to express any opinions on these matters i haven't got any
it seems to me that the best way is to look at the hodge podge be good natured if possible and laugh as from the height of contemplation we view the feeble joints men totter on
i began a tremendous political career during the election having made two stump speeches of an hour and a half each after you went away one in dedham town hall and one in jamaica plain with such eminent success that many invitations came to me from the surrounding villages and if i had continued in active political life i might have risen to be vote distributor or fence viewer or selectman or hog reeve or something of the kind
the letter from which the above passages are quoted gives the same portrait of the writer only seen in profile as it were which we have already seen drawn in full face in the story of morton's hope
it is charged with that saeva indignatio which at times verges on misanthropic contempt for its objects not unnatural to a high spirited young man who sees his lofty ideals confronted with the ignoble facts which strew the highways of political life
but we can recognize real conviction and the deepest feeling beneath his scornful rhetoric and his bitter laugh
he was no more a mere dilettante than swift himself but now and then in the midst of his most serious thought some absurd or grotesque image will obtrude itself and one is reminded of the lines on the monument of gay rather than of the fierce epitaph of the dean of saint patrick's

31 33 first historical and critical essays
peter the great novels of balzac
polity of the puritans
mr motley's first serious effort in historical composition was an article of fifty pages in the north american review for october 1845
this was nominally a notice of two works one on russia the other a memoir of the life of peter the great
it is however a narrative rather than a criticism a rapid continuous brilliant almost dramatic narrative
if there had been any question as to whether the young novelist who had missed his first mark had in him the elements which might give him success as an author this essay would have settled the question
it shows throughout that the writer has made a thorough study of his subject but it is written with an easy and abundant yet scholarly freedom not as if he were surrounded by his authorities and picking out his material piece by piece but rather as if it were the overflow of long pursued and well remembered studies recalled without effort and poured forth almost as a recreation
as he betrayed or revealed his personality in his first novel so in this first effort in another department of literature he showed in epitome his qualities as a historian and a biographer
the hero of his narrative makes his entrance at once in his character as the shipwright of saardam on the occasion of a visit of the great duke of marlborough
his ideal personages had been drawn in such a sketchy way they presented so many imperfectly harmonized features that they never became real with the exception of course of the story teller himself
but the vigor with which the presentment of the imperial ship carpenter the sturdy savage eager fiery peter was given in the few opening sentences showed the movement of the hand the glow of the color that were in due time to display on a broader canvas the full length portraits of william the silent and of john of barneveld
the style of the whole article is rich fluent picturesque with light touches of humor here and there and perhaps a trace or two of youthful jauntiness not quite as yet outgrown
his illustrative poetical quotations are mostly from shakespeare from milton and byron also in a passage or two and now and then one is reminded that he is not unfamiliar with carlyle's sartor resartus and the french revolution of the same unmistakable writer more perhaps by the way in which phrases borrowed from other authorities are set in the text than by any more important evidence of unconscious imitation
the readers who had shaken their heads over the unsuccessful story of morton's hope were startled by the appearance of this manly and scholarly essay
this young man it seemed had been studying studying with careful accuracy with broad purpose
he could paint a character with the ruddy life blood coloring it as warmly as it glows in the cheeks of one of van der helst's burgomasters
he could sweep the horizon in a wide general outlook and manage his perspective and his lights and shadows so as to place and accent his special subject with its due relief and just relations
it was a sketch or rather a study for a larger picture but it betrayed the hand of a master
the feeling of many was that expressed in the words of mr
longfellow in his review of the twice told tales of the unknown young writer nathaniel hawthorne when a new star rises in the heavens people gaze after it for a season with the naked eye and with such telescopes as they may find
but whence o heaven whither
this star is but newly risen and erelong the observation of numerous star gazers perched up on arm chairs and editor's tables will inform the world of its magnitude and its place in the heaven of not poetry in this instance but that serene and unclouded region of the firmament where shine unchanging the names of herodotus and thucydides
those who had always believed in their brilliant schoolmate and friend at last felt themselves justified in their faith
the artist that sent this unframed picture to be hung in a corner of the literary gallery was equal to larger tasks
there was but one voice in the circle that surrounded the young essayist
he must redeem his pledge he can and will redeem it if he will only follow the bent of his genius and grapple with the heroic labor of writing a great history
and this was the achievement he was already meditating
in the mean time he was studying history for its facts and principles and fiction for its scenery and portraits
in the north american review for july 1847 is a long and characteristic article on balzac of whom he was an admirer but with no blind worship
the readers of this great story teller who was so long in obtaining recognition who made twenty assaults upon fame and had forty books killed under him before he achieved success will find his genius fully appreciated and fairly weighed in this discriminating essay
a few brief extracts will show its quality
balzac is an artist and only an artist
in his tranquil unimpassioned remorseless diagnosis of morbid phenomena in his cool method of treating the morbid anatomy of the heart in his curiously accurate dissection of the passions in the patient and painful attention with which stethoscope in hand finger on pulse eye everywhere you see him watching every symptom alive to every sound and every breath and in the scientific accuracy with which he portrays the phenomena which have been the subject of his investigation in all this calm and conscientious study of nature he often reminds us of goethe
balzac however is only an artist
he is neither moral nor immoral but a calm and profound observer of human society and human passions and a minute patient and powerful delineator of scenes and characters in the world before his eyes
his readers must moralize for themselves
it is perhaps his defective style more than anything else which will prevent his becoming a classic for style above all other qualities seems to embalm for posterity
as for his philosophy his principles moral political or social we repeat that he seems to have none whatever
he looks for the picturesque and the striking
he studies sentiments and sensations from an artistic point of view
he is a physiognomist a physiologist a bit of an anatomist a bit of a mesmerist a bit of a geologist a flemish painter an upholsterer a micrological misanthropical sceptical philosopher but he is no moralist and certainly no reformer
another article contributed by mr
motley to the north american review is to be found in the number for october 1849
it is nominally a review of talvi's mrs
robinson's geschichte der colonisation von new england but in reality an essay on the polity of the puritans an historical disquisition on the principles of self government evolved in new england broad in its views eloquent in its language
its spirit is thoroughly american and its estimate of the puritan character is not narrowed by the nearsighted liberalism which sees the past in the pitiless light of the present which looks around at high noon and finds fault with early dawn for its long and dark shadows
here is a sentence or two from the article with all the faults of the system devised by the puritans it was a practical system
with all their foibles with all their teasing tyrannical and arbitrary notions the pilgrims were lovers of liberty as well as sticklers for authority
nowhere can a better description of liberty be found than that given by winthrop in his defence of himself before the general court on a charge of arbitrary conduct
nor would i have you mistake your own liberty he says
there is a freedom of doing what we list without regard to law or justice this liberty is indeed inconsistent with authority but civil moral and federal liberty consists in every man's enjoying his property and having the benefit of the laws of his country which is very consistent with a due subjection to the civil magistrate
we enjoy an inestimable advantage in america
one can be a republican a democrat without being a radical
a radical one who would uproot is a man whose trade is dangerous to society
here is but little to uproot
the trade cannot flourish
all classes are conservative by necessity for none can wish to change the structure of our polity
the country without a past cannot be intoxicated by visions of the past of other lands
upon this absence of the past it seems to us that much of the security of our institutions depends
nothing interferes with the development of what is now felt to be the true principle of government the will of the people legitimately expressed
to establish that great truth nothing was to be torn down nothing to be uprooted
it grew up in new england out of the seed unconsciously planted by the first pilgrims was not crushed out by the weight of a thousand years of error spread over the whole continent and the revolution was proclaimed and recognized

33 35 joseph lewis stackpole the friend of motley
his sudden death motley in the massachusetts house of representatives
second novel merry mount a romance of the massachusetts colony
the intimate friendships of early manhood are not very often kept up among our people
the eager pursuit of fortune position office separates young friends and the indoor home life imprisons them in the domestic circle so generally that it is quite exceptional to find two grown men who are like brothers or rather unlike most brothers in being constantly found together
an exceptional instance of such a more than fraternal relation was seen in the friendship of mr
motley and mr joseph lewis stackpole
mr william amory who knew them both well has kindly furnished me with some recollections which i cannot improve by changing his own language
their intimacy began in europe and they returned to this country in 1835
in 1837 they married sisters and this cemented their intimacy which continued to stackpole's death in 1847
the contrast in the temperament of the two friends the one sensitive and irritable and the other always cool and good natured only increased their mutual attachment to each other and motley's dependence upon stackpole
never were two friends more constantly together or more affectionately fond of each other
as stackpole was about eight years older than motley and much less impulsive and more discreet his death was to his friend irreparable and at the time an overwhelming blow
mr stackpole was a man of great intelligence of remarkable personal attractions and amiable character
his death was a loss to motley even greater than he knew for he needed just such a friend older calmer more experienced in the ways of the world and above all capable of thoroughly understanding him and exercising a wholesome influence over his excitable nature without the seeming of a mentor preaching to a telemachus
mr stackpole was killed by a railroad accident on the 20th of july 1847
in the same letter mr
amory refers to a very different experience in mr
motley's life his one year of service as a member of the massachusetts house of representatives 1849
in respect to the one term during which he was a member of the massachusetts house of representatives i can recall only one thing to which he often and laughingly alluded
motley as the chairman of the committee on education made as he thought a most masterly report
it was very elaborate and as he supposed unanswerable but boutwell then a young man from some country town groton mass
rose and as motley always said demolished the report so that he was unable to defend it against the attack
you can imagine his disgust after the pains he had taken to render it unassailable to find himself as he expressed it on his own dunghill ignominiously beaten
while the result exalted his opinion of the speech making faculty of a representative of a common school education it at the same time cured him of any ambition for political promotion in massachusetts
to my letter of inquiry about this matter hon
george s boutwell courteously returned the following answer boston october 14 1878
my dear sir as my memory serves me mr
motley was a member of the massachusetts house of representatives in the year 1847 1849
it may be well to consult the manual for that year
i recollect the controversy over the report from the committee on education
his failure was not due to his want of faculty or to the vigor of his opponents
in truth he espoused the weak side of the question and the unpopular one also
his proposition was to endow the colleges at the expense of the fund for the support of the common schools
failure was inevitable neither webster nor choate could have carried the bill
very truly geo s
boutwell no one could be more ready and willing to recognize his own failures than motley
he was as honest and manly perhaps i may say as sympathetic with the feeling of those about him on this occasion as was charles lamb who sitting with his sister in the front of the pit on the night when his farce was damned at its first representation gave way to the common feeling and hissed and hooted lustily with the others around him
it was what might be expected from his honest and truthful nature sometimes too severe in judging itself
the commendation bestowed upon motley's historical essays in the north american review must have gone far towards compensating him for the ill success of his earlier venture
it pointed clearly towards the field in which he was to gather his laurels
and it was in the year following the publication of the first essay or about that time 1846 that he began collecting materials for a history of holland
whether to tell the story of men that have lived and of events that have happened or to create the characters and invent the incidents of an imaginary tale be the higher task we need not stop to discuss
but the young author was just now like the great actor in sir joshua's picture between the allurements of thalia and melpomene still doubtful whether he was to be a romancer or a historian
the tale of which the title is given at the beginning of this section had been written several years before the date of its publication
it is a great advance in certain respects over the first novel but wants the peculiar interest which belonged to that as a partially autobiographical memoir
the story is no longer disjointed and impossible
it is carefully studied in regard to its main facts
it has less to remind us of vivian grey and pelham and more that recalls woodstock and kenilworth
the personages were many of them historical though idealized the occurrences were many of them such as the record authenticated the localities were drawn largely from nature
the story betrays marks of haste or carelessness in some portions though others are elaborately studied
his preface shows that the reception of his first book had made him timid and sensitive about the fate of the second and explains and excuses what might be found fault with to disarm the criticism he had some reason to fear
that old watch dog of our american literature the north american review always ready with lambent phrases in stately articles for native talent of a certain pretension and wagging its appendix of critical notices kindly at the advent of humbler merit treated merry mount with the distinction implied in a review of nearly twenty pages
this was a great contrast to the brief and slighting notice of morton's hope
the reviewer thinks the author's descriptive power wholly exceeds his conception of character and invention of circumstances
he dwells perhaps too long and fondly upon his imagination of the landscape as it was before the stillness of the forest had been broken by the axe of the settler but the picture is so finely drawn with so much beauty of language and purity of sentiment that we cannot blame him for lingering upon the scene
the story is not managed with much skill but it has variety enough of incident and character and is told with so much liveliness that few will be inclined to lay it down before reaching the conclusion
the writer certainly needs practice in elaborating the details of a consistent and interesting novel but in many respects he is well qualified for the task and we shall be glad to meet him again on the half historical ground he has chosen
his present work certainly is not a fair specimen of what he is able to accomplish and its failure or partial success ought only to inspirit him for further effort
the half historical ground he had chosen had already led him to the entrance into the broader domain of history
the further effort for which he was to be inspirited had already begun
he had been for some time as was before mentioned collecting materials for the work which was to cast all his former attempts into the kindly shadow of oblivion save when from time to time the light of his brilliant after success is thrown upon them to illustrate the path by which it was at length attained

plan of a history
letters the reputation of mr
prescott was now coextensive with the realm of scholarship
the histories of the reign of ferdinand and isabella and of the conquest of mexico had met with a reception which might well tempt the ambition of a young writer to emulate it but which was not likely to be awarded to any second candidate who should enter the field in rivalry with the great and universally popular historian
but this was the field on which mr
after he had chosen the subject of the history he contemplated he found that mr
prescott was occupied with a kindred one so that there might be too near a coincidence between them
i must borrow from mr
ticknor's beautiful life of prescott the words which introduce a letter of motley's to mr
william amory who has kindly allowed me also to make use of it
the moment therefore that he mr
motley was aware of this condition of things and the consequent possibility that there might be an untoward interference in their plans he took the same frank and honorable course with mr
prescott that mr prescott had taken in relation to mr
irving when he found that they had both been contemplating a history of the conquest of mexico
the result was the same
mr prescott instead of treating the matter as an interference earnestly encouraged mr
motley to go on and placed at his disposition such of the books in his library as could be most useful to him
how amply and promptly he did it mr
motley's own account will best show
it is in a letter dated at rome 26th february 1859 the day he heard of mr
prescott's death and was addressed to his intimate friend mr
william amory of boston mr
prescott's much loved brother in law
it seems to me but as yesterday mr
motley writes though it must be now twelve years ago that i was talking with our ever lamented friend stackpole about my intention of writing a history upon a subject to which i have since that time been devoting myself
i had then made already some general studies in reference to it without being in the least aware that prescott had the intention of writing the history of philip the second
stackpole had heard the fact and that large preparations had already been made for the work although peru had not yet been published
i felt naturally much disappointed
i was conscious of the immense disadvantage to myself of making my appearance probably at the same time before the public with a work not at all similar in plan to philip the second but which must of necessity traverse a portion of the same ground
it is grossly unjust because it takes for granted that loyola and all jesuits were deliberately conscious of imposture and falsehood knowingly embraced the cause of beelzebub and resolutely propagated it
my first thought was inevitably as it were only of myself
it seemed to me that i had nothing to do but to abandon at once a cherished dream and probably to renounce authorship
for i had not first made up my mind to write a history and then cast about to take up a subject
my subject had taken me up drawn me on and absorbed me into itself
it was necessary for me it seemed to write the book i had been thinking much of even if it were destined to fall dead from the press and i had no inclination or interest to write any other
when i had made up my mind accordingly it then occurred to me that prescott might not be pleased that i should come forward upon his ground
it is true that no announcement of his intentions had been made and that he had not i believe even commenced his preliminary studies for philip
at the same time i thought it would be disloyal on my part not to go to him at once confer with him on the subject and if i should find a shadow of dissatisfaction on his mind at my proposition to abandon my plan altogether
i had only the slightest acquaintance with him at that time
i was comparatively a young man and certainly not entitled on any ground to more than the common courtesy which prescott never could refuse to any one
but he received me with such a frank and ready and liberal sympathy and such an open hearted guileless expansiveness that i felt a personal affection for him from that hour
i remember the interview as if it had taken place yesterday
it was in his father's house in his own library looking on the garden house and garden honored father and illustrious son alas
all numbered with the things that were
he assured me that he had not the slightest objection whatever to my plan that he wished me every success and that if there were any books in his library bearing on my subject that i liked to use they were entirely at my service
after i had expressed my gratitude for his kindness and cordiality by which i had been in a very few moments set completely at ease so far as my fears of his disapprobation went i also very naturally stated my opinion that the danger was entirely mine and that it was rather wilful of me thus to risk such a collision at my first venture the probable consequence of which was utter shipwreck
i recollect how kindly and warmly he combated this opinion assuring me that no two books as he said ever injured each other and encouraging me in the warmest and most earnest manner to proceed on the course i had marked out for myself
had the result of that interview been different had he distinctly stated or even vaguely hinted that it would be as well if i should select some other topic or had he only sprinkled me with the cold water of conventional and commonplace encouragement i should have gone from him with a chill upon my mind and no doubt have laid down the pen at once for as i have already said it was not that i cared about writing a history but that i felt an inevitable impulse to write one particular history
you know how kindly he always spoke of and to me and the generous manner in which without the slightest hint from me and entirely unexpected by me he attracted the eyes of his hosts of readers to my forthcoming work by so handsomely alluding to it in the preface to his own must be almost as fresh in your memory as it is in mine
and although it seems easy enough for a man of world wide reputation thus to extend the right hand of fellowship to an unknown and struggling aspirant yet i fear that the history of literature will show that such instances of disinterested kindness are as rare as they are noble
it was not from any feeling that mr
motley was a young writer from whose rivalry he had nothing to apprehend
mr amory says that prescott expressed himself very decidedly to the effect that an author who had written such descriptive passages as were to be found in mr
motley's published writings was not to be undervalued as a competitor by any one
the reader who will turn to the description of charles river in the eighth chapter of the second volume of merry mount or of the autumnal woods in the sixteenth chapter of the same volume will see good reason for mr
prescott's appreciation of the force of the rival whose advent he so heartily and generously welcomed
37 42 historical studies in europe
letter from brussels after working for several years on his projected history of the dutch republic he found that in order to do justice to his subject he must have recourse to the authorities to be found only in the libraries and state archives of europe
in the year 1851 he left america with his family to begin his task over again throwing aside all that he had already done and following up his new course of investigations at berlin dresden the hague and brussels during several succeeding years
i do not know that i can give a better idea of his mode of life during this busy period his occupations his state of mind his objects of interest outside of his special work than by making the following extracts from a long letter to myself dated brussels 20th november 1853
after some personal matters he continued i don't really know what to say to you
i am in a town which for aught i know may be very gay
i don't know a living soul in it
all deep souls see into that
we have not a single acquaintance in the place and we glory in the fact
there is something rather sublime in thus floating on a single spar in the wide sea of a populous busy fuming fussy world like this
at any rate it is consonant to both our tastes
you may suppose however that i find it rather difficult to amuse my friends out of the incidents of so isolated an existence
our daily career is very regular and monotonous
our life is as stagnant as a dutch canal
not that i complain of it on the contrary the canal may be richly freighted with merchandise and be a short cut to the ocean of abundant and perpetual knowledge but at the same time few points rise above the level of so regular a life to be worthy of your notice
you must therefore allow me to meander along the meadows of commonplace
don't expect anything of the impetuous and boiling style
we go it weak here
i don't know whether you were ever in brussels
it is a striking picturesque town built up a steep promontory the old part at the bottom very dingy and mouldy the new part at the top very showy and elegant
nothing can be more exquisite in its way than the grande place in the very heart of the city surrounded with those toppling zigzag ten storied buildings bedizened all over with ornaments and emblems so peculiar to the netherlands with the brocaded hotel de ville on one side with its impossible spire rising some three hundred and seventy feet into the air and embroidered to the top with the delicacy of needle work sugarwork spider work or what you will
i haunt this place because it is my scene my theatre
here were enacted so many deep tragedies so many stately dramas and even so many farces which have been familiar to me so long that i have got to imagine myself invested with a kind of property in the place and look at it as if it were merely the theatre with the coulisses machinery drapery etc
for representing scenes which have long since vanished and which no more enter the minds of the men and women who are actually moving across its pavements than if they had occurred in the moon
when i say that i knew no soul in brussels i am perhaps wrong
with the present generation i am not familiar
en revanche the dead men of the place are my intimate friends
with the fellows of the sixteenth century i am on the most familiar terms
any ghost that ever flits by night across the moonlight square is at once hailed by me as a man and a brother
i call him by his christian name at once
when you come out of this place however which as i said is in the heart of the town the antique gem in the modern setting you may go either up or down
if you go down you will find yourself in the very nastiest complications of lanes and culs de sac possible a dark entanglement of gin shops beer houses and hovels through which charming valley dribbles the senne whence i suppose is derived senna the most nauseous little river in the world which receives all the outpourings of all the drains and houses and is then converted into beer for the inhabitants all the many breweries being directly upon its edge
if you go up the hill instead of down you come to an arrangement of squares palaces and gardens as trim and fashionable as you will find in europe
thus you see that our cybele sits with her head crowned with very stately towers and her feet in a tub of very dirty water
my habits here for the present year are very regular
i came here having as i thought finished my work or rather the first part something like three or four volumes 8vo but i find so much original matter here and so many emendations to make that i am ready to despair
however there is nothing for it but to penelopize pull to pieces and stitch away again
whatever may be the result of my labor nobody can say that i have not worked like a brute beast but i don't care for the result
the labor is in itself its own reward and all i want
i go day after day to the archives here as i went all summer at the hague studying the old letters and documents of the fifteenth century
here i remain among my fellow worms feeding on these musty mulberry leaves out of which we are afterwards to spin our silk
how can you expect anything interesting from such a human cocoon
it is however not without its amusement in a mouldy sort of way this reading of dead letters
it is something to read the real bona fide signs manual of such fellows as william of orange count egmont alexander farnese philip ii
cardinal granvelle and the rest of them
it gives a realizing sense as the americans have it
there are not many public resources of amusement in this place if we wanted them which we don't
i miss the dresden gallery very much and it makes me sad to think that i shall never look at the face of the sistine madonna again that picture beyond all pictures in the world in which the artist certainly did get to heaven and painted a face which was never seen on earth so pathetic so gentle so passionless so prophetic
there are a few good rubenses here but the great wealth of that master is in antwerp
the great picture of the descent from the cross is free again after having been ten years in the repairing room
it has come out in very good condition
what a picture it seems to me as if i had really stood at the cross and seen mary weeping on john's shoulder and magdalen receiving the dead body of the saviour in her arms
never was the grand tragedy represented in so profound and dramatic a manner
for it is not only in his color in which this man so easily surpasses all the world but in his life like flesh and blood action the tragic power of his composition
in action only can we have certainty
and is it not appalling to think of the large constitution of this man when you reflect on the acres of canvas which he has covered
how inspiriting to see with what muscular masculine vigor this splendid fleming rushed in and plucked up drowning art by the locks when it was sinking in the trashy sea of such creatures as the luca giordanos and pietro cortonas and the like
well might guido exclaim the fellow mixes blood with his colors
how providentially did the man come in and invoke living breathing moving men and women out of his canvas
sometimes he is ranting and exaggerated as are all men of great genius who wrestle with nature so boldly
no doubt his heroines are more expansively endowed than would be thought genteel in our country where cryptogams are so much in fashion nevertheless there is always something very tremendous about him and very often much that is sublime pathetic and moving
i defy any one of the average amount of imagination and sentiment to stand long before the descent from the cross without being moved more nearly to tears than he would care to acknowledge
as for color his effects are as sure as those of the sun rising in a tropical landscape
there is something quite genial in the cheerful sense of his own omnipotence which always inspired him
there are a few fine pictures of his here and i go in sometimes of a raw foggy morning merely to warm myself in the blaze of their beauty
i have been more willing to give room to this description of rubens's pictures and the effect they produced upon motley because there is a certain affinity between those sumptuous and glowing works of art and the prose pictures of the historian who so admired them
he was himself a colorist in language and called up the image of a great personage or a splendid pageant of the past with the same affluence the same rich vitality that floods and warms the vast areas of canvas over which the full fed genius of rubens disported itself in the luxury of imaginative creation
42 43 publication of his first historical work rise of the dutch republic
its reception critical notices
the labor of ten years was at last finished
carrying his formidable manuscript with him and how formidable the manuscript which melts down into three solid octavo volumes is only writers and publishers know he knocked at the gate of that terrible fortress from which lintot and curll and tonson looked down on the authors of an older generation
so large a work as the history of the rise of the dutch republic offered for the press by an author as yet unknown to the british public could hardly expect a warm welcome from the great dealers in literature as merchandise
mr murray civilly declined the manuscript which was offered to him and it was published at its author's expense by mr
john chapman the time came when the positions of the first named celebrated publisher and the unknown writer were reversed
mr murray wrote to mr
motley asking to be allowed to publish his second great work the history of the united netherlands expressing at the same time his regret at what he candidly called his mistake in the first instance and thus they were at length brought into business connection as well as the most agreeable and friendly relations
an american edition was published by the harpers at the same time as the london one
if the new work of the unknown author found it difficult to obtain a publisher it was no sooner given to the public than it found an approving an admiring an enthusiastic world of readers and a noble welcome at the colder hands of the critics
the westminster review for april 1856 had for its leading article a paper by mr
froude in which the critic awarded the highest praise to the work of the new historian
as one of the earliest as well as one of the most important recognitions of the work i quote some of its judgments
a history as complete as industry and genius can make it now lies before us of the first twenty years of the revolt of the united provinces of the period in which those provinces finally conquered their independence and established the republic of holland
it has been the result of many years of silent thoughtful unobtrusive labor and unless we are strangely mistaken unless we are ourselves altogether unfit for this office of criticising which we have here undertaken the book is one which will take its place among the finest histories in this or in any language
all the essentials of a great writer mr
motley eminently possesses his mind is broad his industry unwearied
in power of dramatic description no modern historian except perhaps mr
carlyle surpasses him and in analysis of character he is elaborate and distinct
his principles are those of honest love for all which is good and admirable in human character wherever he finds it while he unaffectedly hates oppression and despises selfishness with all his heart
after giving a slight analytical sketch of the series of events related in the history mr
froude objects to only one of the historian's estimates that namely of the course of queen elizabeth
it is ungracious however he says even to find so slight a fault with these admirable volumes
mr motley has written without haste with the leisurely composure of a master
we now take our leave of mr
motley desiring him only to accept our hearty thanks for these volumes which we trust will soon take their place in every english library
our quotations will have sufficed to show the ability of the writer
of the scope and general character of his work we have given but a languid conception
the true merit of a great book must be learned from the book itself
our part has been rather to select varied specimens of style and power
of mr motley's antecedents we know nothing
if he has previously appeared before the public his reputation has not crossed the atlantic
it will not be so now
we believe that we may promise him as warm a welcome among ourselves as he will receive even in america that his place will be at once conceded to him among the first historians in our common language
the faithful and unwearied mr
allibone has swept the whole field of contemporary criticism and shown how wide and universal was the welcome accorded to the hitherto unknown author
an article headed prescott and motley attributed to m
guizot which must have been translated i suppose from his own language judging by its freedom from french idioms is to be found in the edinburgh review for january 1857
the praise not unmingled with criticisms which that great historian bestowed upon motley is less significant than the fact that he superintended a translation of the rise of the dutch republic and himself wrote the introduction to it
a general chorus of approbation followed or accompanied these leading voices
the reception of the work in great britain was a triumph
on the continent in addition to the tribute paid to it by m
guizot it was translated into dutch into german and into russian
at home his reception was not less hearty
the north american review which had set its foot on the semi autobiographical medley which he called morton's hope which had granted a decent space and a tepid recognition to his semi historical romance in which he had already given the reading public a taste of his quality as a narrator of real events and a delineator of real personages this old and awe inspiring new england and more than new england representative of the fates found room for a long and most laudatory article in which the son of one of our most distinguished historians did the honors of the venerable literary periodical to the new comer for whom the folding doors of all the critical headquarters were flying open as if of themselves
mr allibone has recorded the opinions of some of our best scholars as expressed to him
dr lieber wrote a letter to mr
allibone in the strongest terms of praise
i quote one passage which in the light of after events borrows a cruel significance congress and parliament decree thanks for military exploits rarely for diplomatic achievements
if they ever voted their thanks for books and what deeds have influenced the course of human events more than some books
motley ought to have the thanks of our congress but i doubt not that he has already the thanks of every american who has read the work
it will leave its distinct mark upon the american mind
mr everett writes mr
motley's history of the dutch republic is in my judgment a work of the highest merit
unwearying research for years in the libraries of europe patience and judgment in arranging and digesting his materials a fine historical tact much skill in characterization the perspective of narration as it may be called and a vigorous style unite to make it a very capital work and place the name of motley by the side of those of our great historical trio bancroft irving and prescott
mr irving mr bancroft mr
sumner mr hillard united their voices in the same strain of commendation
mr prescott whose estimate of the new history is of peculiar value for obvious reasons writes to mr
allibone thus the opinion of any individual seems superfluous in respect to a work on the merits of which the public both at home and abroad have pronounced so unanimous a verdict
as motley's path crosses my own historic field i may be thought to possess some advantage over most critics in my familiarity with the ground
however this may be i can honestly bear my testimony to the extent of his researches and to the accuracy with which he has given the results of them to the public
far from making his book a mere register of events he has penetrated deep below the surface and explored the cause of these events
he has carefully studied the physiognomy of the times and given finished portraits of the great men who conducted the march of the revolution
every page is instinct with the love of freedom and with that personal knowledge of the working of free institutions which could alone enable him to do justice to his subject
we may congratulate ourselves that it was reserved for one of our countrymen to tell the story better than it had yet been told of this memorable revolution which in so many of its features bears a striking resemblance to our own
the public welcomed the work as cordially as the critics
fifteen thousand copies had already been sold in london in 1857
in america it was equally popular
its author saw his name enrolled by common consent among those of the great writers of his time
europe accepted him his country was proud to claim him scholarship set its jealously guarded seal upon the result of his labors the reading world which had not cared greatly for his stories hung in delight over a narrative more exciting than romances and the lonely student who had almost forgotten the look of living men in the solitude of archives haunted by dead memories found himself suddenly in the full blaze of a great reputation
42 43 visit to america
residence in boylston place
he visited this country in 1856 and spent the winter of 1856 57 in boston living with his family in a house in boylston place
at this time i had the pleasure of meeting him often and of seeing the changes which maturity success the opening of a great literary and social career had wrought in his character and bearing
he was in every way greatly improved the interesting impulsive youth had ripened into a noble manhood
dealing with great themes his own mind had gained their dignity
accustomed to the company of dead statesmen and heroes his own ideas had risen to a higher standard
the flattery of society had added a new grace to his natural modesty
he was now a citizen of the world by his reputation the past was his province in which he was recognized as a master the idol's pedestal was ready for him but he betrayed no desire to show himself upon it

44 46 return to england
social relations lady harcourt's letter
during the years spent in europe in writing his first history from 1851 to 1856 mr
motley had lived a life of great retirement and simplicity devoting himself to his work and to the education of his children to which last object he was always ready to give the most careful supervision
he was as yet unknown beyond the circle of his friends and he did not seek society
in this quiet way he had passed the two years of residence in dresden the year divided between brussels and the hague and a very tranquil year spent at vevay on the lake of geneva
his health at this time was tolerably good except for nervous headaches which frequently recurred and were of great severity
his visit to england with his manuscript in search of a publisher has already been mentioned
in 1858 he revisited england
his fame as a successful author was there before him and he naturally became the object of many attentions
he now made many acquaintances who afterwards became his kind and valued friends
among those mentioned by his daughter lady harcourt are lord lyndhurst lord carlisle lady william russell lord and lady palmerston dean milman with many others
the following winter was passed in rome among many english and american friends
in the course of the next summer his daughter writes to me we all went to england and for the next two years marked chiefly by the success of the united netherlands our social life was most agreeable and most interesting
he was in the fulness of his health and powers his works had made him known in intellectual society and i think his presence on the other hand increased their effects
as no one knows better than you do his belief in his own country and in its institutions at their best was so passionate and intense that it was a part of his nature yet his refined and fastidious tastes were deeply gratified by the influences of his life in england and the spontaneous kindness which he received added much to his happiness
at that time lord palmerston was prime minister the weekly receptions at cambridge house were the centre of all that was brilliant in the political and social world while lansdowne house holland house and others were open to the sommites in all branches of literature science rank and politics
it was the last year of lord macaulay's life and as a few out of many names which i recall come dean milman mr
froude whose review of the dutch republic in the westminster was one of the first warm recognitions it ever received the duke and duchess of argyll sir william stirling maxwell then mr
stirling of keir the sheridan family in its different brilliant members lord wensleydale and many more
there was no society to which motley would not have added grace and attraction by his presence and to say that he was a welcome guest in the best houses of england is only saying that these houses are always open to those whose abilities characters achievements are commended to the circles that have the best choice by the personal gifts which are nature's passport everywhere
letter to mr francis h
underwood plan of mr
motley's historical works second great work history of the united netherlands
i am enabled by the kindness of mr
francis h underwood to avail myself of a letter addressed to him by mr
motley in the year before the publication of this second work which gives us an insight into his mode of working and the plan he proposed to follow
it begins with an allusion which recalls a literary event interesting to many of his american friends
rome march 4 1859
my dear sir i am delighted to hear of the great success of the atlantic monthly
in this remote region i have not the chance of reading it as often as i should like but from the specimens which i have seen i am quite sure it deserves its wide circulation
a serial publication the contents of which are purely original and of such remarkable merit is a novelty in our country and i am delighted to find that it has already taken so prominent a position before the reading world
the whole work his history of which the three volumes already published form a part will be called the eighty years war for liberty
epoch i is the rise of the dutch republic
epoch ii independence achieved
from the death of william the silent till the twelve years truce
1584 1609 epoch iii
independence recognized from the twelve years truce to the peace of westphalia
1609 1648 my subject is a very vast one for the struggle of the united provinces with spain was one in which all the leading states of europe were more or less involved
after the death of william the silent the history assumes world wide proportions
thus the volume which i am just about terminating
is almost as much english history as dutch
the earl of leicester very soon after the death of orange was appointed governor of the provinces and the alliance between the two countries almost amounted to a political union
i shall try to get the whole of the leicester administration terminating with the grand drama of the invincible armada into one volume but i doubt my materials are so enormous
i have been personally very hard at work nearly two years ransacking the british state paper office the british museum and the holland archives and i have had two copyists constantly engaged in london and two others at the hague
besides this i passed the whole of last winter at brussels where by special favor of the belgian government i was allowed to read what no one else has ever been permitted to see the great mass of copies taken by that government from the simancas archives a translated epitome of which has been published by gachard
this correspondence reaches to the death of philip ii
and is of immense extent and importance
had i not obtained leave to read the invaluable and for my purpose indispensable documents at brussels i should have gone to spain for they will not be published these twenty years and then only in a translated and excessively abbreviated and unsatisfactory form
i have read the whole of this correspondence and made very copious notes of it
in truth i devoted three months of last winter to that purpose alone
the materials i have collected from the english archives are also extremely important and curious
i have hundreds of interesting letters never published or to be published by queen elizabeth burghley walsingham sidney drake willoughby leicester and others
for the whole of that portion of my subject in which holland and england were combined into one whole to resist spain in its attempt to obtain the universal empire i have very abundant collections
for the history of the united provinces is not at all a provincial history
it is the history of european liberty
without the struggle of holland and england against spain all europe might have been catholic and spanish
it was holland that saved england in the sixteenth century and by so doing secured the triumph of the reformation and placed the independence of the various states of europe upon a sure foundation
of course the materials collected by me at the hague are of great importance
as a single specimen i will state that i found in the archives there an immense and confused mass of papers which turned out to be the autograph letters of olden barneveld during the last few years of his life during in short the whole of that most important period which preceded his execution
these letters are in such an intolerable handwriting that no one has ever attempted to read them
i could read them only imperfectly myself and it would have taken me a very long time to have acquired the power to do so but my copyist and reader there is the most patient and indefatigable person alive and he has quite mastered the handwriting and he writes me that they are a mine of historical wealth for me
i shall have complete copies before i get to that period one of signal interest and which has never been described
i mention these matters that you may see that my work whatever its other value may be is built upon the only foundation fit for history original contemporary documents
of course i use the contemporary historians and pamphleteers dutch spanish french italian german and english but the most valuable of my sources are manuscript ones
i have said the little which i have said in order to vindicate the largeness of the subject
the kingdom of holland is a small power now but the eighty years war which secured the civil and religious independence of the dutch commonwealth and of europe was the great event of that whole age
the whole work will therefore cover a most remarkable epoch in human history from the abdication of charles fifth to the peace of westphalia at which last point the political and geographical arrangements of europe were established on a permanent basis in the main undisturbed until the french revolution
i will mention that i received yesterday a letter from the distinguished m
guizot informing me that the first volume of the french translation edited by him with an introduction has just been published
the publication was hastened in consequence of the appearance of a rival translation at brussels
the german translation is very elegantly and expensively printed in handsome octavos and the dutch translation under the editorship of the archivist general of holland bakhuyzen v
d brink is enriched with copious notes and comments by that distinguished scholar
there are also three different piratical reprints of the original work at amsterdam leipzig and london
i must add that i had nothing to do with the translation in any case
in fact with the exception of m
guizot no one ever obtained permission of me to publish translations and i never knew of the existence of them until i read of it in the journals
i forgot to say that among the collections already thoroughly examined by me is that portion of the simancas archives still retained in the imperial archives of france
i spent a considerable time in paris for the purpose of reading these documents
there are many letters of philip ii
there with apostilles by his own hand
i would add that i am going to pass this summer at venice for the purpose of reading and procuring copies from the very rich archives of that republic of the correspondence of their envoys in madrid london and brussels during the epoch of which i am treating
i am also not without hope of gaining access to the archives of the vatican here although there are some difficulties in the way
with kind regards i remain very truly yours j
at 46 publication of the first two volumes of the history of the united netherlands
their reception we know something of the manner in which mr
motley collected his materials
we know the labors the difficulties the cost of his toils among the dusty records of the past
what he gained by the years he spent in his researches is so well stated by himself that i shall borrow his own words thanks to the liberality of many modern governments of europe the archives where the state secrets of the buried centuries have so long mouldered are now open to the student of history
to him who has patience and industry many mysteries are thus revealed which no political sagacity or critical acumen could have divined
he leans over the shoulder of philip the second at his writing table as the king spells patiently out with cipher key in hand the most concealed hieroglyphics of parma or guise or mendoza
he reads the secret thoughts of fabius philip ii
as that cunctative roman scrawls his marginal apostilles on each dispatch he pries into all the stratagems of camillus hortensius mucius julius tullius and the rest of those ancient heroes who lent their names to the diplomatic masqueraders of the sixteenth century he enters the cabinet of the deeply pondering burghley and takes from the most private drawer the memoranda which record that minister's unutterable doubtings he pulls from the dressing gown folds of the stealthy soft gliding walsingham the last secret which he has picked from the emperor's pigeon holes or the pope's pocket and which not hatton nor buckhurst nor leicester nor the lord treasurer is to see nobody but elizabeth herself he sits invisible at the most secret councils of the nassaus and barneveld and buys or pores with farnese over coming victories and vast schemes of universal conquest he reads the latest bit of scandal the minutest characteristic of king or minister chronicled by the gossiping venetians for the edification of the forty and after all this prying and eavesdropping having seen the cross purposes the bribings the windings in the dark he is not surprised if those who were systematically deceived did not always arrive at correct conclusions
the fascination of such a quest is readily conceivable
a drama with real characters and the spectator at liberty to go behind the scenes and look upon and talk with the kings and queens between the acts to examine the scenery to handle the properties to study the make up of the imposing personages of full dress histories to deal with them all as thackeray has done with the grand monarque in one of his caustic sketches this would be as exciting one might suppose as to sit through a play one knows by heart at drury lane or the theatre francais and might furnish occupation enough to the curious idler who was only in search of entertainment
the mechanical obstacles of half illegible manuscript of antiquated forms of speech to say nothing of the intentional obscurities of diplomatic correspondence stand however in the way of all but the resolute and unwearied scholar
these difficulties in all their complex obstinacy had been met and overcome by the heroic efforts the concentrated devotion of the new laborer in the unbroken fields of secret history
without stopping to take breath as it were for his was a task de longue haleine he proceeded to his second great undertaking
the first portion consisting of two volumes of the history of the united netherlands was published in the year 1860
it maintained and increased the reputation he had already gained by his first history
the london quarterly review devoted a long article to it beginning with this handsome tribute to his earlier and later volumes mr
motley's history of the rise of the dutch republic is already known and valued for the grasp of mind which it displays for the earnest and manly spirit in which he has communicated the results of deep research and careful reflection
again he appears before us rich with the spoils of time to tell the story of the united netherlands from the time of william the silent to the end of the eventful year of the spanish armada and we still find him in every way worthy of this great argument
indeed it seems to us that he proceeds with an increased facility of style and with a more complete and easy command over his materials
these materials are indeed splendid and of them most excellent use has been made
the english state paper office the spanish archives from simancas and the dutch and belgian repositories have all yielded up their secrets and mr
motley has enjoyed the advantage of dealing with a vast mass of unpublished documents of which he has not failed to avail himself to an extent which places his work in the foremost rank as an authority for the period to which it relates
by means of his labor and his art we can sit at the council board of philip and elizabeth we can read their most private dispatches
guided by his demonstration we are enabled to dissect out to their ultimate issues the minutest ramifications of intrigue
we join in the amusement of the popular lampoon we visit the prison house we stand by the scaffold we are present at the battle and the siege
we can scan the inmost characters of men and can view them in their habits as they lived
after a few criticisms upon lesser points of form and style the writer says but the work itself must be read to appreciate the vast and conscientious industry bestowed upon it
his delineations are true and life like because they are not mere compositions written to please the ear but are really taken from the facts and traits preserved in those authentic records to which he has devoted the labor of many years
diligent and painstaking as the humblest chronicler he has availed himself of many sources of information which have not been made use of by any previous historical writer
at the same time he is not oppressed by his materials but has sagacity to estimate their real value and he has combined with scholarly power the facts which they contain
he has rescued the story of the netherlands from the domain of vague and general narrative and has labored with much judgment and ability to unfold the belli causas et vitia et modos and to assign to every man and every event their own share in the contest and their own influence upon its fortunes
we do not wonder that his earlier publication has been received as a valuable addition not only to english but to european literature
one or two other contemporary criticisms may help us with their side lights
a critic in the edinburgh review for january 1861 thinks that mr
motley has not always been successful in keeping the graphic variety of his details subordinate to the main theme of his work
still he excuses the fault as he accounts it in consideration of the new light thrown on various obscure points of history and it is atoned for by striking merits by many narratives of great events faithfully powerfully and vividly executed by the clearest and most life like conceptions of character and by a style which if it sacrifices the severer principles of composition to a desire to be striking and picturesque is always vigorous full of animation and glowing with the genuine enthusiasm of the writer
mr motley combines as an historian two qualifications seldom found united to great capacity for historical research he adds much power of pictorial representation
in his pages we find characters and scenes minutely set forth in elaborate and characteristic detail which is relieved and heightened in effect by the artistic breadth of light and shade thrown across the broader prospects of history
in an american author too we must commend the hearty english spirit in which the book is written and fertile as the present age has been in historical works of the highest merit none of them can be ranked above these volumes in the grand qualities of interest accuracy and truth
a writer in blackwood may 1861 contrasts motley with froude somewhat in the way in which another critic had contrasted him with prescott
froude he says remembers that there are some golden threads in the black robe of the dominican
motley finds it black and thrusts it farther into the darkness
every writer carries more or less of his own character into his book of course
a great professor has told me that there is a personal flavor in the mathematical work of a man of genius like poisson
those who have known motley and prescott would feel sure beforehand that the impulsive nature of the one and the judicial serenity of the other would as surely betray themselves in their writings as in their conversation and in their every movement
another point which the critic of blackwood's magazine has noticed has not been so generally observed it is what he calls a dashing offhand rattling style fast writing
it cannot be denied that here and there may be detected slight vestiges of the way of writing of an earlier period of motley's literary life with which i have no reason to think the writer just mentioned was acquainted
now and then i can trace in the turn of a phrase in the twinkle of an epithet a faint reminiscence of a certain satirical levity airiness jauntiness if i may hint such a word which is just enough to remind me of those perilous shallows of his early time through which his richly freighted argosy had passed with such wonderful escape from their dangers and such very slight marks of injury
that which is pleasant gayety in conversation may be quite out of place in formal composition and motley's wit must have had a hard time of it struggling to show its spangles in the processions while his gorgeous tragedies went sweeping by
john lothrop motley a memoir by oliver wendell holmes sr
volume ii xvi 1860 1866
aet 46 52 residence in england
outbreak of the civil war
letters to the london times
lady harcourt's letter miss motley's memorandum
the winter of 1859 60 was passed chiefly at oatlands hotel walton on thames
in 1860 mr motley hired the house no
31 hertford street may fair london
he had just published the first two volumes of his history of the netherlands and was ready for the further labors of its continuation when the threats followed by the outbreak of the great civil contention in his native land brought him back from the struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to the conflict of the nineteenth
his love of country which had grown upon him so remarkably of late years would not suffer him to be silent at such a moment
all around him he found ignorance and prejudice
the quarrel was like to be prejudged in default of a champion of the cause which to him was that of liberty and justice
he wrote two long letters to the london times in which he attempted to make clear to englishmen and to europe the nature and conditions of our complex system of government the real cause of the strife and the mighty issues at stake
nothing could have been more timely nothing more needed
mr william everett who was then in england bears strong testimony to the effect these letters produced
had mr motley done no other service to his country this alone would entitle him to honorable remembrance as among the first defenders of the flag which at that moment had more to fear from what was going on in the cabinet councils of europe than from all the armed hosts that were gathering against it
he returned to america in 1861 and soon afterwards was appointed by mr
mr burlingame had been previously appointed to the office but having been objected to by the austrian government for political reasons the place unexpectedly left vacant was conferred upon motley who had no expectation of any diplomatic appointment when he left europe
for some interesting particulars relating to his residence in vienna i must refer to the communications addressed to me by his daughter lady harcourt and her youngest sister and the letters i received from him while at the austrian capital
lady harcourt writes he held the post for six years seeing the civil war fought out and brought to a triumphant conclusion and enjoying as i have every reason to believe the full confidence and esteem of mr
lincoln to the last hour of the president's life
in the first dark years the painful interest of the great national drama was so all absorbing that literary work was entirely put aside and with his countrymen at home he lived only in the varying fortunes of the day his profound faith and enthusiasm sustaining him and lifting him above the natural influence of a by no means sanguine temperament
later when the tide was turning and success was nearing he was more able to work
his social relations during the whole period of his mission were of the most agreeable character
the society of vienna was at that time and i believe is still the absolute reverse of that of england where all claims to distinction are recognized and welcomed
there the old feudal traditions were still in full force and diplomatic representatives admitted to the court society by right of official position found it to consist exclusively of an aristocracy of birth sixteen quarterings of nobility being necessary to a right of presentation to the emperor and empress
the society thus constituted was distinguished by great charm and grace of manner the exclusion of all outer elements not only limiting the numbers but giving the ease of a family party within the charmed circle
on the other hand larger interests suffered under the rigid exclusion of all occupations except the army diplomacy and court place
the intimacy among the different members of the society was so close that beyond a courtesy of manner that never failed the tendency was to resist the approach of any stranger as a gene
a single new face was instantly remarked and commented on in a vienna saloon to an extent unknown in any other large capital
this peculiarity however worked in favor of the old resident
kindliness of feeling increased with familiarity and grew into something better than acquaintance and the parting with most sincere and affectionately disposed friends in the end was deeply felt on both sides
those years were passed in a pleasant house in the weiden faubourg with a large garden at the back and i do not think that during this time there was one disagreeable incident in his relations to his colleagues while in several cases the relations agreeable with all became those of close friendship
we lived constantly of course in diplomatic and austrian society and during the latter part of the time particularly his house was as much frequented and the centre of as many dancing and other receptions as any in the place
his official relations with the foreign office were courteous and agreeable the successive foreign ministers during his stay being count richberg count mensdorff and baron beust
austria was so far removed from any real contact with our own country that though the interest in our war may have been languid they did not pretend to a knowledge which might have inclined them to controversy while an instinct that we were acting as a constituted government against rebellion rather inclined them to sympathy
i think i may say that as he became known among them his keen patriotism and high sense of honor and truth were fully understood and appreciated and that what he said always commanded a sympathetic hearing among men with totally different political ideas but with chivalrous and loyal instincts to comprehend his own
i shall never forget his account of the terrible day when the news of mr
lincoln's death came by some accident a rumor of it reached him first through a colleague
he went straight to the foreign office for news hoping against hope was received by count mensdorff who merely came forward and laid his arm about his shoulder with an intense sympathy beyond words
miss motley the historian's youngest daughter has added a note to her sister's communication during his residence in vienna the most important negotiations which he had to carry on with the austrian government were those connected with the mexican affair
maximilian at one time applied to his brother the emperor for assistance and he promised to accede to his demand
accordingly a large number of volunteers were equipped and had actually embarked at trieste when a dispatch from seward arrived instructing the american minister to give notice to the austrian government that if the troops sailed for mexico he was to leave vienna at once
my father had to go at once to count mensdorff with these instructions and in spite of the foreign minister being annoyed that the united states government had not sooner intimated that this extreme course would be taken the interview was quite amicable and the troops were not allowed to sail
we were in vienna during the war in which denmark fought alone against austria and prussia and when it was over bismarck came to vienna to settle the terms of peace with the emperor
he dined with us twice during his short stay and was most delightful and agreeable
when he and my father were together they seemed to live over the youthful days they had spent together as students and many were the anecdotes of their boyish frolics which bismarck related
47 49 letters from vienna
soon after mr motley's arrival in vienna i received a long letter from him most of which relates to personal matters but which contains a few sentences of interest to the general reader as showing his zealous labors wherever he found himself in behalf of the great cause then in bloody debate in his own country november 14 1861
what can i say to you of cis atlantic things
i am almost ashamed to be away from home
you know that i had decided to remain and had sent for my family to come to america when my present appointment altered my plans
i do what good i can
i think i made some impression on lord john russell with whom i spent two days soon after my arrival in england and i talked very frankly and as strongly as i could to palmerston and i have had long conversations and correspondences with other leading men in england
i have also had an hour's conversation with thouvenel in paris
i hammered the northern view into him as soundly as i could
for this year there will be no foreign interference with us
i don't anticipate it at any time unless we bring it on ourselves by bad management which i don't expect
our fate is in our own hands and europe is looking on to see which side is strongest when it has made the discovery it will back it as also the best and the most moral
yesterday i had my audience with the emperor
he received me with much cordiality and seemed interested in a long account which i gave him of our affairs
you may suppose i inculcated the northern views
we spoke in his vernacular and he asked me afterwards if i was a german
i mention this not from vanity but because he asked it with earnestness and as if it had a political significance
of course i undeceived him
his appearance interested me and his manner is very pleasing
i continued to receive long and interesting letters from him at intervals during his residence as minister at vienna
relating as they often did to public matters about which he had private sources of information his anxiety that they should not get into print was perfectly natural
as however i was at liberty to read his letters to others at my discretion and as many parts of these letters have an interest as showing how american affairs looked to one who was behind the scenes in europe i may venture to give some extracts without fear of violating the spirit of his injunctions or of giving offence to individuals
the time may come when his extended correspondence can be printed in full with propriety but it must be in a future year and after it has passed into the hands of a younger generation
meanwhile these few glimpses at his life and records of his feelings and opinions will help to make the portrait of the man we are studying present itself somewhat more clearly
s a vienna january 14 1862
my dear holmes i have two letters of yours november 29 and december 17 to express my thanks for
it is quite true that it is difficult for me to write with the same feeling that inspires you that everything around the inkstand within a radius of a thousand miles is full of deepest interest to writer and reader
i don't even intend to try to amuse you with vienna matters
what is it to you that we had a very pleasant dinner party last week at prince esterhazy's and another this week at prince liechtenstein's and that to morrow i am to put on my cocked hat and laced coat to make a visit to her imperial majesty the empress mother and that to night there is to be the first of the assembly balls the vienna almack's at which i shall be allowed to absent myself altogether
it strikes me that there is likely to be left a fair field for us a few months longer say till midsummer
the trent affair i shall not say much about except to state that i have always been for giving up the prisoners
i was awfully afraid knowing that the demand had gone forth send us your prisoners or you'll hear of it that the answer would have come back in the hotspur vein and if the devil come and roar for them we will not send them
the result would have been most disastrous for in order to secure a most trifling advantage that of keeping mason and slidell at fort warren a little longer we should have turned our backs on all the principles maintained by us when neutral and should have been obliged to accept a war at an enormous disadvantage
but i hardly dared to hope that we should have obtained such a victory as we have done
to have disavowed the illegal transaction at once before any demand came from england to have placed that disavowal on the broad ground of principle which we have always cherished and thus with a clear conscience and to our entire honor to have kept ourselves clear from a war which must have given the confederacy the invincible alliance of england was exactly what our enemies in europe did not suppose us capable of doing
but we have done it in the handsomest manner and there is not one liberal heart in this hemisphere that is not rejoiced nor one hater of us and of our institutions that is not gnashing his teeth with rage
the letter of ten close pages from which i have quoted these passages is full of confidential information and contains extracts from letters of leading statesmen
if its date had been 1762 i might feel authorized in disobeying its injunctions of privacy
i must quote one other sentence as it shows his animus at that time towards a distinguished statesman of whom he was afterwards accused of speaking in very hard terms by an obscure writer whose intent was to harm him
in speaking of the trent affair mr
motley says the english premier has been foiled by our much maligned secretary of state of whom on this occasion at least one has the right to say with sir henry wotton his armor was his honest thought and simple truth his utmost skill
he says at the close of this long letter i wish i could bore you about something else but american politics
but there is nothing else worth thinking of in the world
we are living over again the days of the dutchmen or the seventeenth century englishmen
my next letter of fourteen closely written pages was of similar character to the last
motley could think of nothing but the great conflict
he was alive to every report from america listening too with passionate fears or hopes as the case might be to the whispers not yet audible to the world which passed from lip to lip of the statesmen who were watching the course of events from the other side of the atlantic with the sweet complacency of the looker on of lucretius too often rejoicing in the storm that threatened wreck to institutions and an organization which they felt to be a standing menace to the established order of things in their older communities
a few extracts from this very long letter will be found to have a special interest from the time at which they were written
my dear holmes i take great pleasure in reading your prophecies and intend to be just as free in hazarding my own for as you say our mortal life is but a string of guesses at the future and no one but an idiot would be discouraged at finding himself sometimes far out in his calculations
if i find you signally right in any of your predictions be sure that i will congratulate and applaud
if you make mistakes you shall never hear of them again and i promise to forget them
let me ask the same indulgence from you in return
this is what makes letter writing a comfort and journalizing dangerous
the ides of march will be upon us before this letter reaches you
we have got to squash the rebellion soon or be squashed forever as a nation
i don't pretend to judge military plans or the capacities of generals
but as you suggest perhaps i can take a more just view of the whole picture of the eventful struggle at this great distance than do those absolutely acting and suffering on the scene
nor can i resist the desire to prophesy any more than you can do knowing that i may prove utterly mistaken
i say then that one great danger comes from the chance of foreign interference
what will prevent that
our utterly defeating the confederates in some great and conclusive battle or our possession of the cotton ports and opening them to european trade or a most unequivocal policy of slave emancipation
any one of these three conditions would stave off recognition by foreign powers until we had ourselves abandoned the attempt to reduce the south to obedience
the last measure is to my mind the most important
the south has by going to war with the united states government thrust into our hands against our will the invincible weapon which constitutional reasons had hitherto forbidden us to employ
at the same time it has given us the power to remedy a great wrong to four millions of the human race in which we had hitherto been obliged to acquiesce
we are threatened with national annihilation and defied to use the only means of national preservation
the question is distinctly proposed to us shall slavery die or the great republic
it is most astounding to me that there can be two opinions in the free states as to the answer
if we do fall we deserve our fate
at the beginning of the contest constitutional scruples might be respectable
but now we are fighting to subjugate the south that is slavery
we are fighting for nothing else that i know of
we are fighting for the union
who wishes to destroy the union
the slaveholder nobody else
are we to spend twelve hundred millions and raise six hundred thousand soldiers in order to protect slavery
it really does seem to me too simple for argument
i am anxiously waiting for the coming columbus who will set this egg of ours on end by smashing in the slavery end
we shall be rolling about in every direction until that is done
i don't know that it is to be done by proclamation
rather perhaps by facts
well i console myself with thinking that the people the american people at least is about as wise collectively as less numerous collections of individuals and that the people has really declared emancipation and is only puzzling how to carry it into effect
after all it seems to be a law of providence that progress should be by a spiral movement so that when it seems most tortuous we may perhaps be going ahead
i am firm in the faith that slavery is now wriggling itself to death
with slavery in its pristine vigor i should think the restored union neither possible nor desirable
don't understand me as not taking into account all the strategical considerations against premature governmental utterances on this great subject
but are there any trustworthy friends to the union among the slaveholders
should we lose many kentuckians and virginians who are now with us if we boldly confiscated the slaves of all rebels
and a confiscation of property which has legs and so confiscates itself at command is not only a legal but would prove a very practical measure in time of war
in brief the time is fast approaching i think when thorough should be written on all our banners
slavery will never accept a subordinate position
the great republic and slavery cannot both survive
we have been defied to mortal combat and yet we hesitate to strike
these are my poor thoughts on this great subject
perhaps you will think them crude
i was much struck with what you quote from mr
conway that if emancipation was proclaimed on the upper mississippi it would be known to the negroes of louisiana in advance of the telegraph
and if once the blacks had leave to run how many whites would have to stay at home to guard their dissolving property
you have had enough of my maunderings
but before i conclude them may i ask you to give all our kindest regards to lowell and to express our admiration for the yankee idyl
i am afraid of using too extravagant language if i say all i think about it
was there ever anything more stinging more concentrated more vigorous more just
he has condensed into those few pages the essence of a hundred diplomatic papers and historical disquisitions and fourth of july orations
i was dining a day or two since with his friend lytton bulwer's son attache here and julian fane secretary of the embassy both great admirers of him and especially of the biglow papers they begged me to send them the mason and slidell idyl but i wouldn't i don't think it is in english nature although theirs is very cosmopolitan and liberal to take such punishment and come up smiling
i would rather they got it in some other way and then told me what they thought voluntarily
i have very pleasant relations with all the j
b s here they are all friendly and well disposed to the north i speak of the embassy which with the ambassador and dress numbers eight or ten souls some of them very intellectual ones
there are no other j
b s here i have no fear at present of foreign interference
we have got three or four months to do our work in a fair field and no favor
there is no question whatever that the southern commissioners have been thoroughly snubbed in london and paris
there is to be a blockade debate in parliament next week but no bad consequences are to be apprehended
the duke de gramont french ambassador and an intimate friend of the emperor told my wife last night that it was entirely false that the emperor had ever urged the english government to break the blockade
don't believe it don't believe a word of it he said
he has always held that language to me
he added that prince napoleon had just come out with a strong speech about us you will see it doubtless before you get this letter but it has not yet reached us
shall i say anything of austria what can i say that would interest you
that's the reason why i hate to write
all my thoughts are in america
do you care to know about the archduke ferdinand maximilian that shall be king hereafter of mexico if l
he is next brother to the emperor but although i have had the honor of private audiences of many archdukes here this one is a resident of trieste
he is about thirty has an adventurous disposition some imagination a turn for poetry has voyaged a good deal about the world in the austrian ship of war for in one respect he much resembles that unfortunate but anonymous ancestor of his the king of bohemia with the seven castles who according to corporal trim had such a passion for navigation and sea affairs with never a seaport in all his dominions
but now the present king of bohemia has got the sway of trieste and is lord high admiral and chief of the marine department
he has been much in spain also in south america i have read some travels reise skizzen of his printed not published
they are not without talent and he ever and anon relieves his prose jog trot by breaking into a canter of poetry
he adores bull fights and rather regrets the inquisition and considers the duke of alva everything noble and chivalrous and the most abused of men
it would do your heart good to hear his invocations to that deeply injured shade and his denunciations of the ignorant and vulgar protestants who have defamed him
n.b let me observe that the r
was not published until long after the reise skizzen were written
du armer alva weil du dem willen deines herrn unerschiitterlich treu vast weil die festbestimmten grundsatze der regierung etc
etc etc you can imagine the rest
dear me i wish i could get back to the sixteenth and seventeenth century
but alas the events of the nineteenth are too engrossing
if lowell cares to read this letter will you allow me to make it over to him jointly as captain cuttle says
i wished to write to him but i am afraid only you would tolerate my writing so much when i have nothing to say
if he would ever send me a line i should be infinitely obliged and would quickly respond
we read the washers of the shroud with fervid admiration
always remember me most sincerely to the club one and all
it touches me nearly when you assure me that i am not forgotten by them
to morrow is saturday and the last of the month
see appendix a we are going to dine with our spanish colleague
but the first bumper of the don's champagne i shall drain to the health of my parker house friends
from another long letter dated august 31 1862 i extract the following passages i quite agree in all that you said in your last letter
it is merely childish to talk of the union as it was
you might as well bring back the saxon heptarchy
but the great republic is destined to live and flourish i can't doubt
do you remember that wonderful scene in faust in which mephistopheles draws wine for the rabble with a gimlet out of the wooden table and how it changes to fire as they drink it and how they all go mad draw their knives grasp each other by the nose and think they are cutting off bunches of grapes at every blow and how foolish they all look when they awake from the spell and see how the devil has been mocking them
it always seems to me a parable of the great secession
i repeat i can't doubt as to the ultimate result
but i dare say we have all been much mistaken in our calculations as to time
days months years are nothing in history
men die man is immortal practically even on this earth
we are so impatient and we are always watching for the last scene of the tragedy
now i humbly opine that the drop is only about falling on the first act or perhaps only the prologue
this act or prologue will be called in after days war for the status quo
such enthusiasm heroism and manslaughter as status quo could inspire has i trust been not entirely in vain but it has been proved insufficient
i firmly believe that when the slaveholders declared war on the united states government they began a series of events that in the logical chain of history cannot come to a conclusion until the last vestige of slavery is gone
looking at the whole field for a moment dispassionately objectively as the dear teutonic philosophers say and merely as an exhibition of phenomena i cannot imagine any other issue
everything else may happen
this alone must happen
but after all this isn't a war
it is a revolution
it is n't strategists that are wanted so much as believers
in revolutions the men who win are those who are in earnest
jeff and stonewall and the other devil worshippers are in earnest but it was not written in the book of fate that the slaveholders rebellion should be vanquished by a pro slavery general
history is never so illogical
no the coming man on horseback on our side must be a great strategist with the soul of that insane lion mad old john brown in his belly
that is your only promethean recipe et insani leonis vim stomacho apposuisse nostro
i don't know why horace runs so in my head this morning
there will be work enough for all but i feel awfully fidgety just now about port royal and hilton head and about affairs generally for the next three months
after that iron clads and the new levies must make us invincible
in another letter dated november 2 1862 he expresses himself very warmly about his disappointment in the attitude of many of his old english friends with reference to our civil conflict
he had recently heard the details of the death of the noble wilder dwight
it is unnecessary he says to say how deeply we were moved
i had the pleasure of knowing him well and i always appreciated his energy his manliness and his intelligent cheerful heroism
i look back upon him now as a kind of heroic type of what a young new englander ought to be and was
i tell you that one of these days after a generation of mankind has passed away these youths will take their places in our history and be regarded by the young men and women now unborn with the admiration which the philip sidneys and the max piccolominis now inspire
after all what was your chevy chace to stir blood with like a trumpet
what noble principle what deathless interest was there at stake
nothing but a bloody fight between a lot of noble gamekeepers on one side and of noble poachers on the other
and because they fought well and hacked each other to pieces like devils they have been heroes for centuries
the letter was written in a very excited state of feeling and runs over with passionate love of country and indignation at the want of sympathy with the cause of freedom which he had found in quarters where he had not expected such coldness or hostile tendencies
from a letter dated vienna september 22 1863
when you wrote me last you said on general matters this in a few days we shall get the news of the success or failure of the attacks on port hudson and vicksburg
if both are successful many will say that the whole matter is about settled
you may suppose that when i got the great news i shook hands warmly with you in the spirit across the atlantic
day by day for so long we had been hoping to hear the fall of vicksburg
at last when that little concentrated telegram came announcing vicksburg and gettysburg on the same day and in two lines i found myself almost alone
there was nobody in the house to join in my huzzahs but my youngest infant
and my conduct very much resembled that of the excellent philip ii
when he heard the fall of antwerp for i went to her door screeching through the key hole vicksburg is ours
just as that other pere de famille more potent but i trust not more respectable than i conveyed the news to his infanta
fide for the incident an american work on the netherlands i
p 263 and the authorities there cited
it is contemptible on my part to speak thus frivolously of events which will stand out in such golden letters so long as america has a history but i wanted to illustrate the yearning for sympathy which i felt
you who were among people grim and self contained usually who i trust were falling on each other's necks in the public streets shouting with tears in their eyes and triumph in their hearts can picture my isolation
i have never faltered in my faith and in the darkest hours when misfortunes seemed thronging most thickly upon us i have never felt the want of anything to lean against but i own i did feel like shaking hands with a few hundred people when i heard of our fourth of july 1863 work and should like to have heard and joined in an american cheer or two
i have not much to say of matters here to interest you
we have had an intensely hot historically hot and very long and very dry summer
i never knew before what a drought meant
in hungary the suffering is great and the people are killing the sheep to feed the pigs with the mutton
here about vienna the trees have been almost stripped of foliage ever since the end of august
there is no glory in the grass nor verdure in anything
in fact we have nothing green here but the archduke max who firmly believes that he is going forth to mexico to establish an american empire and that it is his divine mission to destroy the dragon of democracy and reestablish the true church the right divine and all sorts of games
poor young man our information from home is to the 12th
charleston seems to be in articulo mortis but how forts nowadays seem to fly in the face of scripture
those founded on a rock and built of it fall easily enough under the rain of parrotts and dahlgrens while the house built of sand seems to bid defiance to the storm
in quoting from these confidential letters i have been restrained from doing full justice to their writer by the fact that he spoke with such entire freedom of persons as well as events
but if they could be read from beginning to end no one could help feeling that his love for his own country and passionate absorption of every thought in the strife upon which its existence as a nation depended were his very life during all this agonizing period
he can think and talk of nothing else or if he turns for a moment to other subjects he reverts to the one great central interest of american politics of which he says in one of the letters from which i have quoted there is nothing else worth thinking of in the world

the secretary acquiescing without resistance in a suggestion of the president saw fit to address a formal note to several of the gentlemen mentioned in the m'crackin letter repeating some of its offensive expressions and requesting those officials to deny or confirm the report that they had uttered them
a gentleman who is asked whether he has spoken in a malignant or offensive manner whether he has railed violently and shamefully against the president of the united states or against anybody else might well wonder who would address such a question to the humblest citizen not supposed to be wanting in a common measure of self respect
a gentleman holding an important official station in a foreign country receiving a letter containing such questions signed by the prime minister of his government if he did not think himself imposed upon by a forgery might well consider himself outraged
it was a letter of this kind which was sent by the secretary of state to the minister plenipotentiary to the empire of austria
not quite all the vulgar insolence of the m'crackin letter was repeated
mr seward did not ask mr
motley to deny or confirm the assertion of the letter that he was a thorough flunky and un american functionary
but he did insult him with various questions suggested by the anonymous letter questions that must have been felt as an indignity by the most thick skinned of battered politicians
mr motley was very sensitive very high spirited very impulsive very patriotic and singularly truthful
the letter of mr
seward to such a man was like a buffet on the cheek of an unarmed officer
it stung like the thrust of a stiletto
it roused a resentment that could not find any words to give it expression
he could not wait to turn the insult over in his mind to weigh the exact amount of affront in each question to take counsel to sleep over it and reply to it with diplomatic measure and suavity
one hour had scarcely elapsed before his answer was written
as to his feelings as an american he appeals to his record
this might have shown that if he erred it was on the side of enthusiasm and extravagant expressions of reverence for the american people during the heroic years just passed
he denounces the accusations as pitiful fabrications and vile calumny
he blushes that such charges could have been uttered he is deeply wounded that mr
seward could have listened to such falsehood
he does not hesitate to say what his opinions are with reference to home questions and especially to that of reconstruction
these opinions he says in the privacy of my own household and to occasional american visitors i have not concealed
the great question now presenting itself for solution demands the conscientious scrutiny of every american who loves his country and believes in the human progress of which that country is one of the foremost representatives
i have never thought during my residence at vienna that because i have the honor of being a public servant of the american people i am deprived of the right of discussing within my own walls the gravest subjects that can interest freemen
a minister of the united states does not cease to be a citizen of the united states as deeply interested as others in all that relates to the welfare of his country
among the occasional american visitors spoken of above must have been some of those self appointed or hired agents called interviewers who do for the american public what the venetian spies did for the council of ten what the familiars of the inquisition did for the priesthood who invade every public man's privacy who listen at every key hole who tamper with every guardian of secrets purveyors to the insatiable appetite of a public which must have a slain reputation to devour with its breakfast as the monster of antiquity called regularly for his tribute of a spotless virgin
the interviewer has his use undoubtedly and often instructs and amuses his public with gossip they could not otherwise listen to
he serves the politician by repeating the artless and unstudied remarks which fall from his lips in a conversation which the reporter has been invited to take notes of
he tickles the author's vanity by showing him off as he sits in his library unconsciously uttering the engaging items of self portraiture which as he well knows are to be given to the public in next week's illustrated paper
the feathered end of his shaft titillates harmlessly enough but too often the arrowhead is crusted with a poison worse than the indian gets by mingling the wolf's gall with the rattlesnake's venom
no man is safe whose unguarded threshold the mischief making questioner has crossed
the more unsuspecting the more frank the more courageous the more social is the subject of his vivisection the more easily does he get at his vital secrets if he has any to be extracted
no man is safe if the hearsay reports of his conversation are to be given to the public without his own careful revision
when we remember that a proof text bearing on the mighty question of the future life words of supreme significance uttered as they were in the last hour and by the lips to which we listen as to none other that this text depends for its interpretation on the position of a single comma we can readily see what wrong may be done by the unintentional blunder of the most conscientious reporter
but too frequently it happens that the careless talk of an honest and high minded man only reaches the public after filtering through the drain of some reckless hireling's memory one who has played so long with other men's characters and good name that he forgets they have any value except to fill out his morning paragraphs
whether the author of the scandalous letter which it was disgraceful to the government to recognize was a professional interviewer or only a malicious amateur or whether he was a paid spotter sent by some jealous official to report on the foreign ministers as is sometimes done in the case of conductors of city horsecars or whether the dying miscreant before mentioned told the truth cannot be certainly known
but those who remember mr
hawthorne's account of his consular experiences at liverpool are fully aware to what intrusions and impertinences and impositions our national representatives in other countries are subjected
those fellow citizens who often came to the consulate in parties of half a dozen or more on no business whatever but merely to subject their public servant to a rigid examination and see how he was getting on with his duties may very possibly have included among them some such mischief maker as the author of the odious letter which received official recognition
mr motley had spoken in one of his histories of a set of venomous familiars who glided through every chamber and coiled themselves at every fireside
he little thought that under his own roof he himself was to be the victim of an equally base espionage
it was an insult on the part of the government to have sent mr
motley such a letter with such questions as were annexed to it
no very exact rule can be laid down as to the manner in which an insult shall be dealt with
something depends on temperament and his was of the warmer complexion
his first impulse he says was to content himself with a flat denial of the truth of the accusations
but his scrupulous honesty compelled him to make a plain statement of his opinions and to avow the fact that he had made no secret of them in conversation under conditions where he had a right to speak freely of matters quite apart from his official duties
his answer to the accusation was denial of its charges his reply to the insult was his resignation
it may be questioned whether this was the wisest course but wisdom is often disconcerted by an indignity and even a meek christian may forget to turn the other cheek after receiving the first blow until the natural man has asserted himself by a retort in kind
but the wrong was committed his resignation was accepted the vulgar letter not fit to be spread out on these pages is enrolled in the records of the nation and the first deep wound was inflicted on the proud spirit of one whose renown had shed lustre on the whole country
that the burden of this wrong may rest where it belongs i quote the following statement from mr
jay's paper already referred to
it is due to the memory of mr
seward to say and there would seem now no further motive for concealing the truth that i was told in europe on what i regarded as reliable authority that there was reason to believe that on the receipt of mr
motley's resignation mr seward had written to him declining to accept it and that this letter by a telegraphic order of president johnson had been arrested in the hands of a dispatch agent before its delivery to mr
motley and that the curt letter of the 18th of april had been substituted in its stead
the hon john bigelow late minister to france has published an article in the international review for july august 1878 in which he defends his late friend mr
seward's action in this matter at the expense of the president mr
andrew johnson and not without inferences unfavorable to the discretion of mr
motley many readers will think that the simple record of mr
seward's unresisting acquiescence in the action of the president is far from being to his advantage
i quote from his own conversation as carefully reported by his friend mr
bigelow mr johnson was in a state of intense irritation and more or less suspicious of everybody about him
instead of throwing the letter into the fire the president handed it to him the secretary and suggested answering it and without a word so far as appears he simply answered certainly sir
again the secretary having already written to mr
motley that his answer was satisfactory the president on reaching the last paragraph of mr
motley's letter in which he begged respectfully to resign his post without waiting to learn what mr
seward had done or proposed to do exclaimed with a not unnatural asperity well let him go and on hearing this said mr
seward laughing i did not read my dispatch
many persons will think that the counsel for the defence has stated the plaintiff's case so strongly that there is nothing left for him but to show his ingenuity and his friendship for the late secretary in a hopeless argument
at any rate mr
seward appears not to have made the slightest effort to protect mr
motley against his coarse and jealous chief at two critical moments and though his own continuance in office may have been more important to the state than that of the vicar of bray was to the church he ought to have risked something as it seems to me to shield such a patriot such a gentleman such a scholar from ignoble treatment he ought to have been as ready to guard mr
motley from wrong as mr
bigelow has shown himself to shield mr
seward from reproach and his task if more delicate was not more difficult
i am willing to accept mr
bigelow's loyal and honorable defence of his friend's memory as the best that could be said for mr
seward but the best defence in this case is little better than an impeachment
as for mr johnson he had held the weapon of the most relentless of the parcae so long that his suddenly clipping the thread of a foreign minister's tenure of office in a fit of jealous anger is not at all surprising
thus finished mr motley's long and successful diplomatic service at the court of austria
he may have been judged hasty in resigning his place he may have committed himself in expressing his opinions too strongly before strangers whose true character as spies and eavesdroppers he was too high minded to suspect
but no caution could have protected him against a slanderer who hated the place he came from the company he kept the name he had made famous to whom his very look and bearing such as belong to a gentleman of natural refinement and good breeding must have been a personal grievance and an unpardonable offence
i will add in illustration of what has been said and as showing his feeling with reference to the matter an extract from a letter to me from vienna dated the 12th of march 1867
as so many friends and so many strangers have said so much that is gratifying to me in public and private on this very painful subject it would be like affectation in writing to so old a friend as you not to touch upon it
i shall confine myself however to one fact which so far as i know may be new to you
geo w m'cracken is a man and a name utterly unknown to me
with the necessary qualification which every man who values truth must make when asserting such a negation viz
to the very best of my memory and belief i never set eyes on him nor heard of him until now in the whole course of my life
not a member of my family or of the legation has the faintest recollection of any such person
i am quite convinced that he never saw me nor heard the sound of my voice
that his letter was a tissue of vile calumnies shameless fabrications and unblushing and contemptible falsehoods by whomsoever uttered i have stated in a reply to what ought never to have been an official letter
no man can regret more than i do that such a correspondence is enrolled in the capital among american state papers
i shall not trust myself to speak of the matter
it has been a sufficiently public scandal
xix 1867 1868 aet
53 54 last two volumes of the history of the united netherlands
general criticisms of dutch scholars on motley's historical works
in his letter to me of march 12 1867 just cited mr
motley writes my two concluding volumes of the united netherlands are passing rapidly through the press
indeed volume iii is entirely printed and a third of volume iv
if i live ten years longer i shall have probably written the natural sequel to the first two works viz
the thirty years war
after that i shall cease to scourge the public
i don't know whether my last two volumes are good or bad i only know that they are true but that need n't make them amusing
alas one never knows when one becomes a bore
in 1868 the two concluding volumes of the history of the netherlands were published at the same time in london and in new york
the events described and the characters delineated in these two volumes had perhaps less peculiar interest for english and american readers than some of those which had lent attraction to the preceding ones
there was no scene like the siege of antwerp no story like that of the spanish armada
there were no names that sounded to our ears like those of sir philip sidney and leicester and amy robsart
but the main course of his narrative flowed on with the same breadth and depth of learning and the same brilliancy of expression
the monumental work continued as nobly as it had begun
the facts had been slowly quietly gathered one by one like pebbles from the empty channel of a brook
the style was fluent impetuous abundant impatient as it were at times and leaping the sober boundaries prescribed to it like the torrent which rushes through the same channel when the rains have filled it
thus there was matter for criticism in his use of language
he was not always careful in the construction of his sentences
he introduced expressions now and then into his vocabulary which reminded one of his earlier literary efforts
he used stronger language at times than was necessary coloring too highly shading too deeply in his pictorial delineations
to come to the matter of his narrative it must be granted that not every reader will care to follow him through all the details of diplomatic intrigues which he has with such industry and sagacity extricated from the old manuscripts in which they had long lain hidden
but we turn a few pages and we come to one of those descriptions which arrest us at once and show him in his power and brilliancy as a literary artist
his characters move before us with the features of life we can see elizabeth or philip or maurice not as a name connected with events but as a breathing and acting human being to be loved or hated admired or despised as if he or she were our contemporary
that all his judgments would not be accepted as final we might easily anticipate he could not help writing more or less as a partisan but he was a partisan on the side of freedom in politics and religion of human nature as against every form of tyranny secular or priestly of noble manhood wherever he saw it as against meanness and violence and imposture whether clad in the soldier's mail or the emperor's purple
his sternest critics and even these admiring ones were yet to be found among those who with fundamental beliefs at variance with his own followed him in his long researches among the dusty annals of the past
the work of the learned m
groen van prinsterer maurice et barnevelt etude historique
utrecht 1875 devoted expressly to the revision and correction of what the author considers the erroneous views of mr
motley on certain important points bears notwithstanding such sincere and hearty tribute to his industry his acquisitions his brilliant qualities as a historian that some extracts from it will be read i think with interest
my first interview more than twenty years ago with mr
lothrop motley has left an indelible impression on my memory
a note is handed me from our eminent archivist bakhuyzen van den brink
it informs me that i am to receive a visit from an american who having been struck by the analogies between the united provinces and the united states between washington and the founder of our independence has interrupted his diplomatic career to write the life of william the first that he has already given proof of ardor and perseverance having worked in libraries and among collections of manuscripts and that he is coming to pursue his studies at the hague
while i am surprised and delighted with this intelligence i am informed that mr
motley himself is waiting for my answer
my eagerness to make the acquaintance of such an associate in my sympathies and my labors may be well imagined
but how shall i picture my surprise in presently discovering that this unknown and indefatigable fellow worker has really read i say read and reread our quartos our folios the enormous volumes of bor of van meteren besides a multitude of books of pamphlets and even of unedited documents
already he is familiar with the events the changes of condition the characteristic details of the life of his and my hero
not only is he acquainted with my archives but it seems as if there was nothing in this voluminous collection of which he was ignorant
in sending me the last volume of his history of the foundation of the republic of the netherlands mr
motley wrote to me without the help of the archives i could never have undertaken the difficult task i had set myself and you will have seen at least from my numerous citations that i have made a sincere and conscientious study of them
certainly in reading such a testimonial i congratulated myself on the excellent fruit of my labors but the gratitude expressed to me by mr
motley was sincerely reciprocated
the archives are a scientific collection and my manual of national history written in dutch hardly gets beyond the limits of my own country
and here is a stranger become our compatriot in virtue of the warmth of his sympathies who has accomplished what was not in my power
by the detail and the charm of his narrative by the matter and form of a work which the universality of the english language and numerous translations were to render cosmopolitan mr
motley like that other illustrious historian prescott lost to science by too early death has popularized in both hemispheres the sublime devotion of the prince of orange the exceptional and providential destinies of my country and the benedictions of the eternal for all those who trust in him and tremble only at his word
the old dutch scholar differs in many important points from mr
motley as might be expected from his creed and his life long pursuits
this i shall refer to in connection with motley's last work john of barneveld
an historian among archivists and annalists reminds one of sir john lubbock in the midst of his ant hills
undoubtedly he disturbs the ants in their praiseworthy industry much as his attentions may flatter them
unquestionably the ants if their means of expressing themselves were equal to their apparent intellectual ability could teach him many things that he has overlooked and correct him in many mistakes
but the ants will labor ingloriously without an observer to chronicle their doings and the archivists and annalists will pile up facts forever like so many articulates or mollusks or radiates until the vertebrate historian comes with his generalizing ideas his beliefs his prejudices his idiosyncrasies of all kinds and brings the facts into a more or less imperfect but still organic series of relations
the history which is not open to adverse criticism is worth little except as material for it is written without taking cognizance of those higher facts about which men must differ of which guizot writes as follows as quoted in the work of m
it is with facts that our minds are exercised it has nothing but facts as its materials and when it discovers general laws these laws are themselves facts which it determines
in the study of facts the intelligence may allow itself to be crushed it may lower narrow materialize itself it may come to believe that there are no facts except those which strike us at the first glance which come close to us which fall as we say under our senses a great and gross error there are remote facts immense obscure sublime very difficult to reach to observe to describe and which are not any less facts for these reasons and which man is not less obliged to study and to know and if he fails to recognize them or forgets them his thought will be prodigiously abashed and all his ideas carry the stamp of this deterioration
in that higher region of facts which belongs to the historian whose task it is to interpret as well as to transcribe mr
motley showed of course the political and religious school in which he had been brought up
every man has a right to his personal equation of prejudice and mr
motley whose ardent temperament gave life to his writings betrayed his sympathies in the disputes of which he told the story in a way to insure sharp criticism from those of a different way of thinking
thus it is that in the work of m
groen van prinsterer from which i have quoted he is considered as having been betrayed into error while his critic recognizes his manifest desire to be scrupulously impartial and truth telling
and m fruin another of his dutch critics says his sincerity his perspicacity the accuracy of his laborious researches are incontestable
some of the criticisms of dutch scholars will be considered in the pages which deal with his last work the life of john of barneveld
residence at no 2 park street boston
address on the coming presidential election
address on historic progress and american democracy
appointed minister to england
in june 1868 mr
motley returned with his family to boston and established himself in the house no
2 park street during his residence here he entered a good deal into society and entertained many visitors in a most hospitable and agreeable way
on the 20th of october 1868 he delivered an address before the parker fraternity in the music hall by special invitation
its title was four questions for the people at the presidential election
this was of course what is commonly called an electioneering speech but a speech full of noble sentiments and eloquent expression
here are two of its paragraphs certainly there have been bitterly contested elections in this country before
party spirit is always rife and in such vivid excitable disputatious communities as ours are and i trust always will be it is the very soul of freedom
to those who reflect upon the means and end of popular government nothing seems more stupid than in grand generalities to deprecate party spirit
why government by parties and through party machinery is the only possible method by which a free government can accomplish the purpose of its existence
the old republics of the past may be said to have fallen not because of party spirit but because there was no adequate machinery by which party spirit could develop itself with facility and regularity
and if our republic be true to herself the future of the human race is assured by our example
no sweep of overwhelming armies no ponderous treatises on the rights of man no hymns to liberty though set to martial music and resounding with the full diapason of a million human throats can exert so persuasive an influence as does the spectacle of a great republic occupying a quarter of the civilized globe and governed quietly and sagely by the people itself
a large portion of this address is devoted to the proposition that it is just and reasonable to pay our debts rather than to repudiate them and that the nation is as much bound to be honest as is the individual
it is an awful thing he says that this should be a question at all but it was one of the points on which the election turned for all that
in his advocacy of the candidate with whom and the government of which he became the head his relations became afterwards so full of personal antagonism he spoke as a man of his ardent nature might be expected to speak on such an occasion
no one doubts that his admiration of general grant's career was perfectly sincere and no one at the present day can deny that the great captain stood before the historian with such a record as one familiar with the deeds of heroes and patriots might well consider as entitling him to the honors too often grudged to the living to be wasted on the dead
the speaker only gave voice to the widely prevailing feelings which had led to his receiving the invitation to speak
the time was one which called for outspoken utterance and there was not a listener whose heart did not warm as he heard the glowing words in which the speaker recorded the noble achievements of the soldier who must in so many ways have reminded him of his favorite character william the silent
on the 16th of december of this same year 1868 mr
motley delivered an address before the new york historical society on the occasion of the sixty fourth anniversary of its foundation
the president of the society mr
hamilton fish introduced the speaker as one whose name belongs to no single country and to no single age
as a statesman and diplomatist and patriot he belongs to america as a scholar to the world of letters as a historian all ages will claim him in the future
his subject was historic progress and american democracy
the discourse is to use his own words a rapid sweep through the eons and the centuries illustrating the great truth of the development of the race from its origin to the time in which we are living
it is a long distance from the planetary fact of the obliquity of the equator which gave the earth its alternation of seasons and rendered the history if not the existence of man and of civilization a possibility to the surrender of general lee under the apple tree at appomattox court house
no one but a scholar familiar with the course of history could have marshalled such a procession of events into a connected and intelligible sequence
it is indeed a flight rather than a march the reader is borne along as on the wings of a soaring poem and sees the rising and decaying empires of history beneath him as a bird of passage marks the succession of cities and wilds and deserts as he keeps pace with the sun in his journey
its eloquence its patriotism its crowded illustrations drawn from vast resources of knowledge its epigrammatic axioms its occasional pleasantries are all characteristic of the writer
mr gulian c verplanck the venerable senior member of the society proposed the vote of thanks to mr
motley with words of warm commendation
mr william cullen bryant rose and said i take great pleasure in seconding the resolution which has just been read
the eminent historian of the dutch republic who has made the story of its earlier days as interesting as that of athens and sparta and who has infused into the narrative the generous glow of his own genius has the highest of titles to be heard with respectful attention by the citizens of a community which in its origin was an offshoot of that renowned republic
and cheerfully has that title been recognized as the vast audience assembled here to night in spite of the storm fully testifies and well has our illustrious friend spoken of the growth of civilization and of the improvement in the condition of mankind both in the old world the institutions of which he has so lately observed and in the country which is proud to claim him as one of her children
soon after the election of general grant mr
motley received the appointment of minister to england
that the position was one which was in many respects most agreeable to him cannot be doubted
yet it was not with unmingled feelings of satisfaction not without misgivings which warned him but too truly of the dangers about to encompass him that he accepted the place
he writes to me on april 16 1869 i feel anything but exultation at present rather the opposite sensation
i feel that i am placed higher than i deserve and at the same time that i am taking greater responsibilities than ever were assumed by me before
you will be indulgent to my mistakes and shortcomings and who can expect to avoid them
but the world will be cruel and the times are threatening
i shall do my best but the best may be poor enough and keep a heart for any fate
xxi 1869 1870 aet
55 56 recall from the english mission
its alleged and its probable reasons
the misgivings thus expressed to me in confidence natural enough in one who had already known what it is to fall on evil days and evil tongues were but too well justified by after events
i could have wished to leave untold the story of the english mission an episode in motley's life full of heart burnings and long to be regretted as a passage of american history
but his living appeal to my indulgence comes to me from his grave as a call for his defence however little needed at least as a part of my tribute to his memory
it is little needed because the case is clear enough to all intelligent readers of our diplomatic history and because his cause has been amply sustained by others in many ways better qualified than myself to do it justice
the task is painful for if a wrong was done him it must be laid at the doors of those whom the nation has delighted to honor and whose services no error of judgment or feeling or conduct can ever induce us to forget
if he confessed him self liable like the rest of us to mistakes and shortcomings we must remember that the great officers of the government who decreed his downfall were not less the subjects of human infirmity
the outline to be filled up is this a new administration had just been elected
the alabama treaty negotiated by motley's predecessor mr
reverdy johnson had been rejected by the senate
the minister was recalled and motley nominated without opposition and unanimously confirmed by the senate was sent to england in his place
he was welcomed most cordially on his arrival at liverpool and replied in a similar strain of good feeling expressing the same kindly sentiments which may be found in his instructions
soon after arriving in london he had a conversation with lord clarendon the british foreign secretary of which he sent a full report to his own government
while the reported conversation was generally approved of in the government's dispatch acknowledging it it was hinted that some of its expressions were stronger than were required by the instructions and that one of its points was not conveyed in precise conformity with the president's view
the criticism was very gently worded and the dispatch closed with a somewhat guarded paragraph repeating the government's approbation
this was the first offence alleged against mr
motley the second ground of complaint was that he had shown written minutes of this conversation to lord clarendon to obtain his confirmation of its exactness and that he had as he said inadvertently omitted to make mention to the government of this circumstance until some weeks after the time of the interview
he was requested to explain to lord clarendon that a portion of his presentation and treatment of the subject discussed at the interview immediately after his arrival was disapproved by the secretary of state and he did so in a written communication in which he used the very words employed by mr
fish in his criticism of the conversation with lord clarendon
an alleged mistake a temperate criticism coupled with a general approval a rectification of the mistake criticised
all this within the first two months of mr
motley's official residence in london
no further fault was found with him so far as appears in the discharge of his duties to which he must have devoted himself faithfully for he writes to me under the date of december 27 1870 i have worked harder in the discharge of this mission than i ever did in my life
this from a man whose working powers astonished the old dutch archivist groen van prinsterer means a good deal
more than a year had elapsed since the interview with lord clarendon which had been the subject of criticism
in the mean time a paper of instructions was sent to motley dated september 25 1869 in which the points in the report of his interview which had been found fault with are so nearly covered by similar expressions that there seemed no real ground left for difference between the government and the minister
whatever over statement there had been these new instructions would imply that the government was now ready to go quite as far as the minister had gone and in some points to put the case still more strongly
everything was going on quietly
important business had been transacted with no sign of distrust or discontent on the part of the government as regarded motley
whatever mistake he was thought to have committed was condoned by amicable treatment neutralized by the virtual indorsement of the government in the instructions of the 25th of september and obsolete as a ground of quarrel by lapse of time
the question about which the misunderstanding if such it deserves to be called had taken place was no longer a possible source of disagreement as it had long been settled that the alabama case should only be opened again at the suggestion of the british government and that it should be transferred to washington whenever that suggestion should again bring it up for consideration
such was the aspect of affairs at the american legation in london
no foreign minister felt more secure in his place than mr
motley i thought myself he says in the letter of december 27 entirely in the confidence of my own government and i know that i had the thorough confidence and the friendship of the leading personages in england
all at once on the first of july 1870 a letter was written by the secretary of state requesting him to resign
this gentle form of violence is well understood in the diplomatic service
horace walpole says speaking of lady archibald hamilton they have civilly asked her and grossly forced her to ask civilly to go away which she has done with a pension of twelve hundred a year
such a request is like the embrace of the virgin in old torture chambers
she is robed in soft raiment but beneath it are the knife blades which are ready to lacerate and kill the victim if he awaits the pressure of the machinery already in motion
mr motley knew well what was the logical order in an official execution and saw fit to let the government work its will upon him as its servant
in november he was recalled
the recall of a minister under such circumstances is an unusual if not an unprecedented occurrence
the government which appoints a citizen to represent the country at a foreign court assumes a very serious obligation to him
the next administration may turn him out and nothing will be thought of it
he may be obliged to ask for his passports and leave all at once if war is threatened between his own country and that which he represents
he may of course be recalled for gross misconduct
but his dismissal is very serious matter to him personally and not to be thought of on the ground of passion or caprice
marriage is a simple business but divorce is a very different thing
the world wants to know the reason of it the law demands its justification
it was a great blow to mr
motley a cause of indignation to those who were interested in him a surprise and a mystery to the world in general
when he his friends and the public all startled by this unexpected treatment looked to find an explanation of it one was found which seemed to many quite sufficient
mr sumner had been prominent among those who had favored his appointment
a very serious breach had taken place between the president and mr
sumner on the important san domingo question
it was a quarrel in short neither more nor less at least so far as the president was concerned
the proposed san domingo treaty had just been rejected by the senate on the thirtieth day of june and immediately thereupon the very next day the letter requesting mr
motley's resignation was issued by the executive
this fact was interpreted as implying something more than a mere coincidence
it was thought that sumner's friend who had been supported by him as a candidate for high office who shared many of his political ideas and feelings who was his intimate associate his fellow townsman his companion in scholarship and cultivation his sympathetic co laborer in many ways had been accounted and dealt with as the ally of an enemy and that the shaft which struck to the heart of the sensitive envoy had glanced from the aes triplex of the obdurate senator
mr motley wrote a letter to the secretary of state immediately after his recall in which he reviewed his relations with the government from the time of his taking office and showed that no sufficient reason could be assigned for the treatment to which he had been subjected
he referred finally to the public rumor which assigned the president's hostility to his friend sumner growing out of the san domingo treaty question as the cause of his own removal and to the coincidence between the dates of the rejection of the treaty and his dismissal with an evident belief that these two occurrences were connected by something more than accident
to this a reply was received from the secretary of state's office signed by mr
fish but so objectionable in its tone and expressions that it has been generally doubted whether the paper could claim anything more of the secretary's hand than his signature
it travelled back to the old record of the conversation with lord clarendon more than a year and a half before took up the old exceptions warmed them over into grievances and joined with them whatever the captatores verborum not extinct since daniel webster's time could add to their number
this was the letter which was rendered so peculiarly offensive by a most undignified comparison which startled every well bred reader
no answer was possible to such a letter and the matter rested until the death of mr
motley caused it to be brought up once more for judgment
the honorable john jay in his tribute to the memory of mr
motley read at a meeting of the new york historical society vindicated his character against the attacks of the late executive in such a way as to leave an unfavorable impression as to the course of the government
objection was made on this account to placing the tribute upon the minutes of the society
this led to a publication by mr
jay entitled motley's appeal to history in which the propriety of the society's action is questioned and the wrong done to him insisted upon and further illustrated
the defence could not have fallen into better hands
bearing a name which is in itself a title to the confidence of the american people a diplomatist familiar with the rights the customs the traditions the courtesies which belong to the diplomatic service the successor of mr
motley at vienna and therefore familiar with his official record not self made which too commonly means half made but with careful training added to the instincts to which he had a right by inheritance he could not allow the memory of such a scholar of such a high minded lover of his country of so true a gentleman as mr
motley to remain without challenge under the stigma of official condemnation
i must refer to mr
jay's memorial tribute as printed in the newspapers of the day and to his appeal published in the international review for his convincing presentation of the case and content myself with a condensed statement of the general and special causes of complaint against mr
motley and the explanations which suggest themselves as abundantly competent to show the insufficiency of the reasons alleged by the government as an excuse for the manner in which he was treated
the grounds of complaint against mr
motley are to be looked for 1
in the letter of mr
fish to mr moran of december 30 1870
2 in mr bancroft davis's letter to the new york herald of january 4 1878 entitled mr
sumner the alabama claims and their settlement
3 the reported conversations of general grant
4 the reported conversations of mr
fish in considering mr
fish's letter we must first notice its animus
the manner in which dickens's two old women are brought in is not only indecorous but it shows a state of feeling from which nothing but harsh interpretation of every questionable expression of mr
motley's was to be expected
there is not the least need of maintaining the perfect fitness and rhetorical felicity of every phrase and every word used by him in his interview with lord clarendon
it is not to be expected that a minister when about to hold a conversation with a representative of the government to which he is accredited will commit his instructions to memory and recite them like a school boy speaking his piece
he will give them more or less in his own language amplifying it may be explaining illustrating at any rate paraphrasing in some degree but endeavoring to convey an idea of their essential meaning
in fact as any one can see a conversation between two persons must necessarily imply a certain amount of extemporization on the part of both
i do not believe any long and important conference was ever had between two able men without each of them feeling that he had not spoken exactly in all respects as he would if he could say all over again
doubtless therefore mr motley's report of his conversation shows that some of his expressions might have been improved and others might as well have been omitted
a man does not change his temperament on taking office
general jackson still swore by the eternal and his illustrious military successor of a more recent period seems by his own showing to have been able to sudden impulses of excitement
yet not too much must be made of this concession
only a determination to make out a case could as it seems to me have framed such an indictment as that which the secretary constructed by stringing together a slender list of pretended peccadillos
one instance will show the extreme slightness which characterizes many of the grounds of inculpation the instructions say the government in rejecting the recent convention abandons neither its own claims nor those of its citizens etc
mr motley said in the course of his conversation at present the united states government while withdrawing neither its national claims nor the claims of its individual citizens against the british government etc
mr fish says the determination of this government not to abandon its claims nor those of its citizens was stated parenthetically and in such a subordinate way as not necessarily to attract the attention of lord clarendon
what reported conversation can stand a captious criticism like this
are there not two versions of the ten commandments which were given out in the thunder and smoke of sinai and would the secretary hold that this would have been a sufficient reason to recall moses from his divine legation at the court of the almighty
there are certain expressions which as mr
fish shows them apart from their connection do very certainly seem in bad taste if not actually indiscreet and unjustifiable
let me give an example instead of expressing the hope entertained by this government that there would be an early satisfactory and friendly settlement of the questions at issue he volunteered the unnecessary and from the manner in which it was thrust in the highly objectionable statement that the united states government had no insidious purposes etc
this sounds very badly as mr
fish puts it let us see how it stands in its proper connection he lord clarendon added with some feeling that in his opinion it would be highly objectionable that the question should be hung up on a peg to be taken down at some convenient moment for us when it might be difficult for the british government to enter upon its solution and when they might go into the debate at a disadvantage
these were as nearly as i can remember his words and i replied very earnestly that i had already answered that question when i said that my instructions were to propose as brief a delay as would probably be requisite for the cooling of passions and for producing the calm necessary for discussing the defects of the old treaty and a basis for a new one
the united states government had no insidious purposes etc
is it not evident that lord clarendon suggested the idea which mr
motley repelled as implying an insidious mode of action
is it not just as clear that mr
fish's way of reproducing the expression without the insinuation which called it forth is a practical misstatement which does mr
motley great wrong one more example of the method of wringing a dry cloth for drops of evidence ought to be enough to show the whole spirit of the paper
mr fish in his instructions it might indeed well have occurred in the event of the selection by lot of the arbitrator or umpire in different cases involving however precisely the same principles that different awards resting upon antagonistic principles might have been made
mr motley in the conversation with lord clarendon i called his lordship's attention to your very judicious suggestion that the throwing of the dice for umpires might bring about opposite decisions in cases arising out of identical principles
he agreed entirely that no principle was established by the treaty but that the throwing of dice or drawing of lots was not a new invention on that occasion but a not uncommon method in arbitrations
i only expressed the opinion that such an aleatory process seemed an unworthy method in arbitrations etc
mr fish in his letter to mr
moran that he had in his mind at that interview something else than his letter of instructions from this department would appear to be evident when he says that he called his lordship's attention to your my very judicious suggestion that the throwing of dice for umpire might bring about opposite decisions
the instructions which mr
motley received from me contained no suggestion about throwing of dice
that idea is embraced in the suggestive words aleatory process adopted by mr
motley but previously applied in a speech made in the senate on the question of ratifying the treaty
charles sumner's speech on the johnson clarendon treaty april 13 1869 in the event of failure to agree the arbitrator is determined by lot out of two persons named by each side
even if this aleatory proceeding were a proper device in the umpirage of private claims it is strongly inconsistent with the solemnity which belongs to the present question
it is suggestive that the critical secretary so keen in detecting conversational inaccuracies having but two words to quote from a printed document got one of them wrong
but this trivial comment must not lead the careful reader to neglect to note how much is made of what is really nothing at all
the word aleatory whether used in its original and limited sense or in its derived extension as a technical term of the civil law was appropriate and convenient one especially likely to be remembered by any person who had read mr
sumner's speech and everybody had read it the secretary himself doubtless got the suggestion of determining the question by lot from it
what more natural than that it should be used again when the subject of appealing to chance came up in conversation
it was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted and we were fortunate in having a minister who was scholar enough to know what it meant
the language used by mr
motley conveyed the idea of his instructions plainly enough and threw in a compliment to their author which should have saved this passage at least from the wringing process
the example just given is like the concession of belligerency to the insurgents by great britain chiefly important as showing animus
it is hardly necessary to bring forward other instances of virtual misrepresentation
if mr motley could have talked his conversation over again he would very probably have changed some expressions
but he felt bound to repeat the interview exactly as it occurred with all the errors to which its extemporaneous character exposed it
when a case was to be made out against him the secretary wrote december 30 1870 well might he say as he did in a subsequent dispatch on the 15th of july 1869 that he had gone beyond the strict letter of his instructions
he might have added in direct opposition to their temper and spirit
of the same report the secretary had said june 28 1869 your general presentation and treatment of the several subjects discussed in that interview meet the approval of this department
this general approval is qualified by mild criticism of a single statement as not having been conveyed in precise conformity to the president's view
the minister was told he might be well content to rest the question on the very forcible presentation he had made of the american side of the question and that if there were expressions used stronger than were required by his instructions they were in the right direction
the mere fact that a minute of this conversation was confidentially submitted to lord clarendon in order that our own government might have his authority for the accuracy of the record which was intended exclusively for its own use and that this circumstance was overlooked and not reported to the government until some weeks afterward are the additional charges against mr
motley the submission of the dispatch containing an account of the interview the secretary says is not inconsistent with diplomatic usage but it is inconsistent with the duty of a minister not to inform his government of that submission
mr motley submitted the draft of his no
8 to lord clarendon and failed to communicate that fact to his government
he did inform mr
fish at any rate on the 30th of july and alleged inadvertence as the reason for his omission to do it before
inasmuch as submitting the dispatch was not inconsistent with diplomatic usage nothing seems left to find fault with but the not very long delay in mentioning the fact or in his making the note private and confidential as is so frequently done in diplomatic correspondence
such were the grounds of complaint
on the strength of the conversation which had met with the general approval of the government tempered by certain qualifications and of the omission to report immediately to the government the fact of its verification by lord clarendon the secretary rests the case against mr
motley on these grounds it was that according to him the president withdrew all right to discuss the alabama question from the minister whose dismissal was now only a question of time
but other evidence comes in here
mr motley says it was as i supposed understood before my departure for england although not publicly announced that the so called alabama negotiations whenever renewed should be conducted at washington in case of the consent of the british government
mr sumner says in his explanation in reply to an assault the secretary in a letter to me at boston dated at washington october 9 1869 informs the that the discussion of the question was withdrawn from london because the italics are the secretary's we think that when renewed it can be carried on here with a better prospect of settlement than where the late attempt at a convention which resulted so disastrously and was conducted so strangely was had and what the secretary thus wrote he repeated in conversation when we met carefully making the transfer to washington depend upon our advantage here from the presence of the senate thus showing that the pretext put forth to wound mr
again we may fairly ask how the government came to send a dispatch like that of september 25 1869 in which the views and expressions for which mr
motley's conversation had been criticised were so nearly reproduced and with such emphasis that mr
motley says in a letter to me dated april 8 1871 it not only covers all the ground which i ever took but goes far beyond it
no one has ever used stronger language to the british government than is contained in that dispatch
it is very able and well worth your reading
lord clarendon called it to me sumner's speech over again
it was thought by the english cabinet to have out sumnered sumner and now our government thinking that every one in the united states had forgotten the dispatch makes believe that i was removed because my sayings and doings in england were too much influenced by sumner
mr motley goes on to speak of the report that an offer of his place in england was made to sumner to get him out of the way of san domingo
the facts concerning this offer are now sufficiently known to the public
here i must dismiss mr
fish's letter to mr
moran having as i trust sufficiently shown the spirit in which it was written and the strained interpretations and manifest overstatements by which it attempts to make out its case against mr
motley i will not parade the two old women whose untimely and unseemly introduction into the dress circle of diplomacy was hardly to have been expected of the high official whose name is at the bottom of this paper
they prove nothing they disprove nothing they illustrate nothing except that a statesman may forget himself
neither will i do more than barely allude to the unfortunate reference to the death of lord clarendon as connected with mr
motley's removal so placidly disposed of by a sentence or two in the london times of january 24 1871
i think we may consider ourselves ready for the next witness
mr j c bancroft davis assistant secretary of state under president grant and secretary fish wrote a letter to the new york herald under the date of january 4 1878 since reprinted as a pamphlet and entitled mr
mr sumner was never successfully attacked when living except with a bludgeon and his friends have more than sufficiently vindicated him since his death
but mr motley comes in for his share of animadversion in mr
davis's letter he has nothing of importance to add to mr
fish's criticisms on the interview with lord clarendon
only he brings out the head and front of mr
motley's offending by italicizing three very brief passages from his conversation at this interview not discreetly as it seems to me for they will not bear the strain that is put upon them
these are the passages 1
but that such measures must always be taken with a full view of the grave responsibilities assumed
2 and as being the fountain head of the disasters which had been caused to the american people
3 as the fruits of the proclamation
1 it is true that nothing was said of responsibility in mr
motley's instructions but the idea was necessarily involved in their statements
for if as mr
motley's instructions say the right of a power to define its own relations etc
when a civil conflict has arisen in another state depends on its the conflict's having attained a sufficient complexity magnitude and completeness inasmuch as that power has to judge whether it has or has not fulfilled these conditions and is of course liable to judge wrong every such act of judgment must be attended with grave responsibilities
the instructions say that the necessity and propriety of the original concession of belligerency by great britain at the time it was made have been contested and are not admitted
it follows beyond dispute that great britain may in this particular case have incurred grave responsibilities in fact the whole negotiations implied as much
perhaps mr motley need not have used the word responsibilities
but considering that the government itself said in dispatch no
70 september 25 1869 the president does not deny on the contrary he maintains that every sovereign power decides for itself on its responsibility whether or not it will at a given time accord the status of belligerency etc
it was hardly worth while to use italics about mr
motley's employment of the same language as constituting a grave cause of offence
2 mr motley's expression as being the fountain head of the disasters is a conversational paraphrase of the words of his instructions as it shows the beginning and the animus of that course of conduct which resulted so disastrously which is not in precise conformity with his instructions but is just such a variation as is to be expected when one is talking with another and using the words that suggest themselves at the moment just as the familiar expression hung up on a peg probably suggested itself to lord clarendon
3 the fruits of the proclamation is so inconsiderable a variation on the text of the instructions supplemented by acts causing direct damage that the secretary's hint about want of precise conformity seems hardly to have been called for
it is important to notice this point in the instructions with other powers mr
motley was to take the position that the recognition of the insurgents state of war was made no ground of complaint with great britain that the cause of grievance was not so much placed upon the issuance of this recognition as upon her conduct under and subsequent to such recognition
there is no need of maintaining the exact fitness of every expression used by mr
motley but any candid person who will carefully read the government's dispatch no
70 dated september 25 1869 will see that a government holding such language could find nothing in mr
motley's expressions in a conversation held at his first official interview to visit with official capital punishment more than a year afterwards
if mr motley had as it was pretended followed sumner mr
mr davis's pamphlet would hardly be complete without a mysterious letter from an unnamed writer whether a faithless friend a disguised enemy a secret emissary or an injudicious alarmist we have no means of judging for ourselves
the minister appears to have been watched by somebody in london as he was in vienna
this somebody wrote a private letter in which he expressed fear and regret that mr
motley's bearing in his social intercourse was throwing obstacles in the way of a future settlement
the charge as mentioned in mr
davis's letter is hardly entitled to our attention
mr sumner considered it the work of an enemy and the recollection of the m'crackin letter might well have made the government cautious of listening to complaints of such a character
this somebody may have been one whom we should call nobody
we cannot help remembering how well outis served oduxseus of old when he was puzzled to extricate himself from an embarrassing position
stat nominis umbra is a poor showing for authority to support an attack on a public servant exposed to every form of open and insidious abuse from those who are prejudiced against his person or his birthplace who are jealous of his success envious of his position hostile to his politics dwarfed by his reputation or hate him by the divine right of idiosyncrasy always liable too to questioning comment from well meaning friends who happen to be suspicious or sensitive in their political or social relations
the reported sayings of general grant and of mr
fish to the correspondents who talked with them may be taken for what they are worth
they sound naturally enough to have come from the speakers who are said to have uttered them
i quote the most important part of the edinburgh letter september 11 1877 to the new york herald
these are the words attributed to general grant mr
motley was certainly a very able very honest gentleman fit to hold any official position
but he knew long before he went out that he would have to go
when i was making these appointments mr
sumner came to me and asked me to appoint mr
motley as minister to the court of st
james i told him i would and did
soon after mr sumner made that violent speech about the alabama claims and the british government was greatly offended
mr sumner was at the time chairman of the committee on foreign affairs
mr motley had to be instructed
the instructions were prepared very carefully and after governor fish and i had gone over them for the last time i wrote an addendum charging him that above all things he should handle the subject of the alabama claims with the greatest delicacy
mr motley instead of obeying his explicit instructions deliberately fell in line with sumner and thus added insult to the previous injury
as soon as i heard of it i went over to the state department and told governor fish to dismiss motley at once
i was very angry indeed and i have been sorry many a time since that i did not stick to my first determination
mr fish advised delay because of sumner's position in the senate and attitude on the treaty question
we did not want to stir him up just then
we dispatched a note of severe censure to motley at once and ordered him to abstain from any further connection with that question
we thereupon commenced negotiations with the british minister at washington and the result was the joint high commission and the geneva award
i supposed mr motley would be manly enough to resign after that snub but he kept on till he was removed
mr sumner promised me that he would vote for the treaty
general grant talked again at cairo in egypt
grant then referred to the statement published at an interview with him in scotland and said the publication had some omissions and errors
he had no ill will towards mr
motley who like other estimable men made mistakes and motley made a mistake which made him an improper person to hold office under me
it is proper to say of me that i killed motley or that i made war upon sumner for not supporting the annexation of san domingo
but if i dare to answer that i removed motley from the highest considerations of duty as an executive if i presume to say that he made a mistake in his office which made him no longer useful to the country if fish has the temerity to hint that sumner's temper was so unfortunate that business relations with him became impossible we are slandering the dead
nothing but mortimer those who knew both men the ex president and the late senator would agree i do not doubt that they would not be the most promising pair of human beings to make harmonious members of a political happy family
cedant arma togae the life long sentiment of sumner in conflict with stand fast and stand sure the well known device of the clan of grant reminds one of the problem of an irresistible force in collision with an insuperable resistance
but the president says or is reported as saying i may be blamed for my opposition to mr
sumner's tactics but i was not guided so much by reason of his personal hatred of myself as i was by a desire to protect our national interests in diplomatic affairs
it would be useless says mr
davis in his letter to the herald to enter into a controversy whether the president may or may not have been influenced in the final determination of the moment for requesting motley's resignation by the feeling caused by sumner's personal hostility and abuse of himself
unfortunately this controversy had been entered into and the idleness of suggesting any relation of cause and effect between mr
motley's dismissal and the irritation produced in the president's mind by the rejection of the san domingo treaty which rejection was mainly due to motley's friend sumner's opposition strongly insisted upon in a letter signed by the secretary of state
too strongly for here it was that he failed to remember what was due to his office to himself and to the gentleman of whom he was writing if indeed it was the secretary's own hand which held the pen and not another's
we might as well leave out the wrath of achilles from the iliad as the anger of the president with sumner from the story of motley's dismissal
the sad recital must always begin with m
he was he is reported as saying very angry indeed with motley because he had fallen in line with sumner
he couples them together in his conversation as closely as chang and eng were coupled
the death of lord clarendon would have covered up the coincidence between the rejection of the san domingo treaty and mr
motley's dismissal very neatly but for the inexorable facts about its date as revealed by the london times
it betrays itself as an afterthought and its failure as a defence reminds us too nearly of the trial in which mr
webster said suicide is confession
it is not strange that the spurs of the man who had so lately got out of the saddle should catch in the scholastic robe of the man on the floor of the senate
but we should not have looked for any such antagonism between the secretary of state and the envoy to great britain
on the contrary they must have had many sympathies and it must have cost the secretary pain as he said it did to be forced to communicate with mr
moran instead of with mr
motley he too was inquired of by one of the emissaries of the american unholy inquisition
his evidence is thus reported the reason for mr
motley's removal was found in considerations of state
he misrepresented the government on the alabama question especially in the two speeches made by him before his arrival at his post
these must be the two speeches made to the american and the liverpool chambers of commerce
if there is anything in these short addresses beyond those civil generalities which the occasion called out i have failed to find it
if it was in these that the reason of mr
motley's removal was to be looked for it is singular that they are not mentioned in the secretary's letter to mr
moran or by mr
davis in his letter to the new york herald
they must have been as unsuccessful as myself in the search after anything in these speeches which could be construed into misinterpretation of the government on the alabama question
we may much more readily accept considerations of state as a reason for mr
motley's removal considerations of state have never yet failed the axe or the bowstring when a reason for the use of those convenient implements was wanted and they are quite equal to every emergency which can arise in a republican autocracy
but for the very reason that a minister is absolutely in the power of his government the manner in which that power is used is always open to the scrutiny and if it has been misused to the condemnation of a tribunal higher than itself a court that never goes out of office and which no personal feelings no lapse of time can silence
the ostensible grounds on which mr
motley was recalled are plainly insufficient to account for the action of the government
if it was in great measure a manifestation of personal feeling on the part of the high officials by whom and through whom the act was accomplished it was a wrong which can never be repaired and never sufficiently regretted
stung by the slanderous report of an anonymous eavesdropper to whom the government of the day was not ashamed to listen he had quitted vienna too hastily it may be but wounded indignant feeling that he had been unworthily treated
the sudden recall from london on no pretext whatever but an obsolete and overstated incident which had ceased to have any importance was under these circumstances a deadly blow
it fell upon the new healed wound of malice and though he would not own it and bore up against it it was a shock from which he never fully recovered
i hope i am one of those he writes to me from the hague in 1872 who fortune's buffets and rewards can take with equal thanks
i am quite aware that i have had far more than i deserve of political honors and they might have had my post as a voluntary gift on my part had they remembered that i was an honorable man and not treated me as a detected criminal deserves to be dealt with
mr sumner naturally felt very deeply what he considered the great wrong done to his friend
he says how little mr
motley merited anything but respect and courtesy from the secretary is attested by all who know his eminent position in london and the service he rendered to his country
already the london press usually slow to praise americans when strenuous for their country has furnished its voluntary testimony
the daily news of august 16 1870 spoke of the insulted minister in these terms we are violating no confidence in saying that all the hopes of mr
motley's official residence in england have been amply fulfilled and that the announcement of his unexpected and unexplained recall was received with extreme astonishment and unfeigned regret
the vacancy he leaves cannot possibly be filled by a minister more sensitive to the honor of his government more attentive to the interests of his country and more capable of uniting the most vigorous performance of his public duties with the high bred courtesy and conciliatory tact and temper that make those duties easy and successful
mr motley's successor will find his mission wonderfully facilitated by the firmness and discretion that have presided over the conduct of american affairs in this country during too brief a term too suddenly and unaccountably concluded
no man can escape being found fault with when it is necessary to make out a case against him
a diplomatist is watched by the sharpest eyes and commented on by the most merciless tongues
the best and wisest has his defects and sometimes they would seem to be very grave ones if brought up against him in the form of accusation
take these two portraits for instance as drawn by john quincy adams
the first is that of stratford canning afterwards lord stratford de redcliffe he is to depart to morrow
i shall probably see him no more
he is a proud high tempered englishman of good but not extraordinary parts stubborn and punctilious with a disposition to be overbearing which i have often been compelled to check in its own way
he is of all the foreign ministers with whom i have had occasion to treat the man who has most severely tried my temper
yet he has been long in the diplomatic career and treated with governments of the most opposite characters
he has however a great respect for his word and there is nothing false about him
this is an excellent quality for a negotiator
mr canning is a man of forms studious of courtesy and tenacious of private morals
as a diplomatic man his great want is suppleness and his great virtue is sincerity
the second portrait is that of the french minister hyde de neuville no foreign minister who ever resided here has been so universally esteemed and beloved nor have i ever been in political relations with any foreign statesman of whose moral qualities i have formed so good an opinion with the exception of count romanzoff
he has not sufficient command of his temper is quick irritable sometimes punctilious occasionally indiscreet in his discourse and tainted with royalist and bourbon prejudices
but he has strong sentiments of honor justice truth and even liberty
his flurries of temper pass off as quickly as they rise
he is neither profound nor sublime nor brilliant but a man of strong and good feelings with the experience of many vicissitudes of fortune a good but common understanding and good intentions biassed by party feelings occasional interests and personal affections
it means very little to say that a man has some human imperfections or that a public servant might have done some things better
but when a questionable cause is to be justified the victim's excellences are looked at with the eyes of liliput and his failings with those of brobdingnag
the recall of a foreign minister for alleged misconduct in office is a kind of capital punishment
it is the nearest approach to the sultan's bowstring which is permitted to the chief magistrate of our republic
a general can do nothing under martial law more peremptory than a president can do with regard to the public functionary whom he has appointed with the advice and consent of the senate but whom he can officially degrade and disgrace at his own pleasure for insufficient cause or for none at all
like the centurion of scripture he says go and he goeth
the nation's representative is less secure in his tenure of office than his own servant to whom he must give warning of his impending dismissal
a breath unmakes him as a breath has made
the chief magistrate's responsibility to duty to the fellow citizen at his mercy to his countrymen to mankind is in proportion to his power
his prime minister the agent of his edicts should feel bound to withstand him if he seeks to gratify a personal feeling under the plea of public policy unless the minister like the slaves of the harem is to find his qualification for office in leaving his manhood behind him
the two successive administrations which treated mr
motley in a manner unworthy of their position and cruel if not fatal to him have been heard directly or through their advocates
i have attempted to show that the defence set up for their action is anything but satisfactory
a later generation will sit in judgment upon the evidence more calmly than our own
it is not for a friend like the writer to anticipate its decision but unless the reasons alleged to justify his treatment and which have so much the air of afterthoughts shall seem stronger to that future tribunal than they do to him the verdict will be that mr
motley was twice sacrificed to personal feelings which should never have been cherished by the heads of the government and should never have been countenanced by their chief advisers
volume iii xxii 1874
aet 60 life of john of barneveld
criticisms groen van prinsterer
the full title of mr
motley's next and last work is the life and death of john of barneveld advocate of holland with a view of the primary causes and movements of the thirty years war
in point of fact this work is a history rather than a biography
it is an interlude a pause between the acts which were to fill out the complete plan of the eighty years tragedy and of which the last act the thirty years war remains unwritten
the life of barneveld was received as a fitting and worthy continuation of the series of intellectual labor in which he was engaged
i will quote but two general expressions of approval from the two best known british critical reviews
in connection with his previous works it forms says the london quarterly a fine and continuous story of which the writer and the nation celebrated by him have equal reason to be proud a narrative which will remain a prominent ornament of american genius while it has permanently enriched english literature on this as well as on the other side of the atlantic
the edinburgh review speaks no less warmly we can hardly give too much appreciation to that subtile alchemy of the brain which has enabled him to produce out of dull crabbed and often illegible state papers the vivid graphic and sparkling narrative which he has given to the world
in a literary point of view m
groen van prinsterer whose elaborate work has been already referred to speaks of it as perhaps the most classical of motley's productions but it is upon this work that the force of his own and other dutch criticisms has been chiefly expended
the key to this biographical history or historical biography may be found in a few sentences from its opening chapter
there have been few men at any period whose lives have been more closely identical than his barneveld's with a national history
there have been few great men in any history whose names have become less familiar to the world and lived less in the mouths of posterity
yet there can be no doubt that if william the silent was the founder of the independence of the united provinces barneveld was the founder of the commonwealth itself
had that country of which he was so long the first citizen maintained until our own day the same proportional position among the empires of christendom as it held in the seventeenth century the name of john of barneveld would have perhaps been as familiar to all men as it is at this moment to nearly every inhabitant of the netherlands
even now political passion is almost as ready to flame forth either in ardent affection or enthusiastic hatred as if two centuries and a half had not elapsed since his death
his name is so typical of a party a polity and a faith so indelibly associated with a great historical cataclysm as to render it difficult even for the grave the conscientious the learned the patriotic of his own compatriots to speak of him with absolute impartiality
a foreigner who loves and admires all that is great and noble in the history of that famous republic and can have no hereditary bias as to its ecclesiastical or political theories may at least attempt the task with comparative coldness although conscious of inability to do thorough justice to a most complex subject
with all mr motley's efforts to be impartial to which even his sternest critics bear witness he could not help becoming a partisan of the cause which for him was that of religious liberty and progress as against the accepted formula of an old ecclesiastical organization
for the quarrel which came near being a civil war which convulsed the state and cost barneveld his head had its origin in a difference on certain points and more especially on a single point of religious doctrine
as a great river may be traced back until its fountainhead is found in a thread of water streaming from a cleft in the rocks so a great national movement may sometimes be followed until its starting point is found in the cell of a monk or the studies of a pair of wrangling professors
the religious quarrel of the dutchmen in the seventeenth century reminds us in some points of the strife between two parties in our own new england sometimes arraying the church on one side against the parish or the general body of worshippers on the other
the portraits of gomarus the great orthodox champion and arminius the head and front of the liberal theology of his day as given in the little old quarto of meursius recall two ministerial types of countenance familiar to those who remember the earlier years of our century
under the name of remonstrants and contra remonstrants arminians and old fashioned calvinists as we should say the adherents of the two leyden professors disputed the right to the possession of the churches and the claim to be considered as representing the national religion
of the seven united provinces two holland and utrecht were prevailingly arminian and the other five calvinistic
barneveld who under the title of advocate represented the province of holland the most important of them all claimed for each province a right to determine its own state religion
maurice the stadholder son of william the silent the military chief of the republic claimed the right for the states general
cujus regio ejus religio was then the accepted public doctrine of protestant nations
thus the provincial and the general governments were brought into conflict by their creeds and the question whether the republic was a confederation or a nation the same question which has been practically raised and for the time at least settled in our own republic was in some way to be decided
after various disturbances and acts of violence by both parties maurice representing the states general pronounced for the calvinists or contra remonstrants and took possession of one of the great churches as an assertion of his authority
barneveld representing the arminian or remonstrant provinces levied a body of mercenary soldiers in several of the cities
these were disbanded by maurice and afterwards by an act of the states general
barneveld was apprehended imprisoned and executed after an examination which was in no proper sense a trial
grotius who was on the arminian side and involved in the inculpated proceedings was also arrested and imprisoned
his escape by a stratagem successfully repeated by a slave in our own times may challenge comparison for its romantic interest with any chapter of fiction
how his wife packed him into the chest supposed to contain the folios of the great oriental scholar erpenius how the soldiers wondered at its weight and questioned whether it did not hold an arminian how the servant maid elsje van houwening quick witted as morgiana of the forty thieves parried their questions and convoyed her master safely to the friendly place of refuge all this must be read in the vivid narrative of the author
the questions involved were political local personal and above all religious
here is the picture which motley draws of the religious quarrel as it divided the people in burghers mansions peasants cottages mechanics back parlors on board herring smacks canal boats and east indiamen in shops counting rooms farm yards guard rooms alehouses on the exchange in the tennis court on the mall at banquets at burials christenings or bridals wherever and whenever human creatures met each other there was ever to be found the fierce wrangle of remonstrant and contra remonstrant the hissing of red hot theological rhetoric the pelting of hostile texts
the blacksmith's iron cooled on the anvil the tinker dropped a kettle half mended the broker left a bargain unclinched the scheveningen fisherman in his wooden shoes forgot the cracks in his pinkie while each paused to hold high converse with friend or foe on fate free will or absolute foreknowledge losing himself in wandering mazes whence there was no issue
province against province city against city family against family it was one vast scene of bickering denunciation heart burnings mutual excommunication and hatred
the religious grounds of the quarrel which set these seventeenth century dutchmen to cutting each other's throats were to be looked for in the five points of the arminians as arrayed against the seven points of the gomarites or contra remonstrants
the most important of the differences which were to be settled by fratricide seem to have been these according to the five points god has from eternity resolved to choose to eternal life those who through his grace believe in jesus christ etc
according to the seven points god in his election has not looked at the belief and the repentance of the elect etc
according to the five points all good deeds must be ascribed to god's grace in christ but it does not work irresistibly
the language of the seven points implies that the elect cannot resist god's eternal and unchangeable design to give them faith and steadfastness and that they can never wholly and for always lose the true faith
the language of the five points is unsettled as to the last proposition but it was afterwards maintained by the remonstrant party that a true believer could through his own fault fall away from god and lose faith
it must be remembered that these religious questions had an immediate connection with politics
independently of the conflict of jurisdiction in which they involved the parties to the two different creeds it was believed or pretended that the new doctrines of the remonstrants led towards romanism and were allied with designs which threatened the independence of the country
there are two factions in the land said maurice that of orange and that of spain and the two chiefs of the spanish faction are those political and priestly arminians uytenbogaert and oldenbarneveld
the heads of the two religious and political parties were in such hereditary long continued and intimate relations up to the time when one signed the other's death warrant that it was impossible to write the life of one without also writing that of the other
for his biographer john of barneveld is the true patriot the martyr whose cause was that of religious and political freedom
for him maurice is the ambitious soldier who hated his political rival and never rested until this rival was brought to the scaffold
the questions which agitated men's minds two centuries and a half ago are not dead yet in the country where they produced such estrangement violence and wrong
no stranger could take them up without encountering hostile criticism from one party or the other
it may be and has been conceded that mr
motley writes as a partisan a partisan of freedom in politics and religion as he understands freedom
this secures him the antagonism of one class of critics
but these critics are themselves partisans and themselves open to the cross fire of their antagonists
m groen van prinsterer the learned and distinguished editor of the archives et correspondance of the orange and nassau family published a considerable volume before referred to in which many of motley's views are strongly controverted
but he himself is far from being in accord with that eminent scholar m
bakhuyzen van den brink whose name he says is celebrated enough to need no comment or with m
fruin of whose impartiality and erudition he himself speaks in the strongest terms
the ground upon which he is attacked is thus stated in his own words people have often pretended to find in my writings the deplorable influence of an extreme calvinism
the puritans of the seventeenth century are my fellow religionists
i am a sectarian and not an historian
it is plain enough to any impartial reader that there are at least plausible grounds for this accusation against mr
motley's critic and on a careful examination of the formidable volume it becomes obvious that mr
motley has presented a view of the events and the personages of the stormy epoch with which he is dealing which leaves a battle ground yet to be fought over by those who come after him
the dispute is not and cannot be settled
the end of all religious discussion has come when one of the parties claims that it is thinking or acting under immediate divine guidance
it is god's affair and his honor is touched says william lewis to prince maurice
mr motley's critic is not less confident in claiming the almighty as on the side of his own views
let him state his own ground of departure to show the difference let me rather say the contrast between the point of view of mr
motley and my own between the unitarian and the evangelical belief
i am issue of calvin child of the awakening reveil
faithful to the device of the reformers justification by faith alone and the word of god endures eternally
i consider history from the point of view of merle d'aubigne chalmers guizot
i desire to be disciple and witness of our lord and saviour jesus christ
he is therefore of necessity antagonistic to a writer whom he describes in such words as these mr
motley is liberal and rationalist
he becomes in attacking the principle of the reformation the passionate opponent of the puritans and of maurice the ardent apologist of barnevelt and the arminians
it is understood and he makes no mystery of it that he inclines towards the vague and undecided doctrine of the unitarians
what m groen's idea of unitarians is may be gathered from the statement about them which he gets from a letter of de tocqueville
they are pure deists they talk about the bible because they do not wish to shock too severely public opinion which is prevailingly christian
they have a service on sundays i have been there
at it they read verses from dryden or other english poets on the existence of god and the immortality of the soul
they deliver a discourse on some point of morality and all is said
in point of fact the wave of protest which stormed the dikes of dutch orthodoxy in the seventeenth century stole gently through the bars of new england puritanism in the eighteenth
though the large number says mr
bancroft still acknowledged the fixedness of the divine decrees and the resistless certainty from all eternity of election and of reprobation there were not wanting even among the clergy some who had modified the sternness of the ancient doctrine by making the self direction of the active powers of man with freedom of inquiry and private judgment the central idea of a protest against calvinism
protestantism cut loose from an infallible church and drifting with currents it cannot resist wakes up once or oftener in every century to find itself in a new locality
then it rubs its eyes and wonders whether it has found its harbor or only lost its anchor
there is no end to its disputes for it has nothing but a fallible vote as authority for its oracles and these appeal only to fallible interpreters
it is as hard to contend in argument against the oligarchy of heaven as motley calls the calvinistic party as it was formerly to strive with them in arms
to this aristocracy of god's elect belonged the party which framed the declaration of the synod of dort the party which under the forms of justice shed the blood of the great statesman who had served his country so long and so well
to this chosen body belonged the late venerable and truly excellent as well as learned m
groen van prinsterer and he exercised the usual right of examining in the light of his privileged position the views of a liberal and rationalist writer who goes to meeting on sunday to hear verses from dryden
this does not diminish his claim for a fair reading of the intimate correspondence which he considers mr
motley has not duly taken into account and of the other letters to be found printed in his somewhat disjointed and fragmentary volume
this intimate correspondence shows maurice the stadholder indifferent and lax in internal administration and as being constantly advised and urged by his relative count william of nassau
this need of constant urging extends to religious as well as other matters and is inconsistent with m
groen van prinsterer's assertion that the question was for maurice above all religious and for barneveld above all political
whether its negative evidence can be considered as neutralizing that which is adduced by mr
motley to show the stadholder's hatred of the advocate may be left to the reader who has just risen from the account of the mock trial and the swift execution of the great and venerable statesman
the formal entry on the record upon the day of his judicial murder is singularly solemn and impressive monday 13th may 1619
to day was executed with the sword here in the hague on a scaffold thereto erected in the binnenhof before the steps of the great hall mr
john of barneveld in his life knight lord of berkel rodenrys etc
advocate of holland and west friesland for reasons expressed in the sentence and otherwise with confiscation of his property after he had served the state thirty three years two months and five days since 8th march 1586 a man of great activity business memory and wisdom yea extraordinary in every respect
here is the everlasting yea
he that stands let him see that he does not fall
maurice gave an account of the execution of barneveld to count william lewis on the same day in a note painfully brief and dry
most authors write their own biography consciously or unconsciously
we have seen mr
motley portraying much of himself his course of life and his future as he would have had it in his first story
in this his last work it is impossible not to read much of his own external and internal personal history told under other names and with different accessories
the parallelism often accidentally or intentionally passes into divergence
he would not have had it too close if he could but there are various passages in which it is plain enough that he is telling his own story
mr motley was a diplomatist and he writes of other diplomatists and one in particular with most significant detail
it need not be supposed that he intends the arch intriguer aerssens to stand for himself or that he would have endured being thought to identify himself with the man of whose almost devilish acts he speaks so freely
but the sagacious reader and he need not be very sharp sighted will very certainly see something more than a mere historical significance in some of the passages which i shall cite for him to reflect upon
mr motley's standard of an ambassador's accomplishments may be judged from the following passage that those ministers those of the republic were second to the representatives of no other european state in capacity and accomplishment was a fact well known to all who had dealings with them for the states required in their diplomatic representatives knowledge of history and international law modern languages and the classics as well as familiarity with political customs and social courtesies the breeding of gentlemen in short and the accomplishments of scholars
the story of the troubles of aerssens the ambassador of the united provinces at paris must be given at some length and will repay careful reading
francis aerssens continued to be the dutch ambassador after the murder of henry iv
he was beyond doubt one of the ablest diplomatists in europe
versed in many languages a classical student familiar with history and international law a man of the world and familiar with its usages accustomed to associate with dignity and tact on friendliest terms with sovereigns eminent statesmen and men of letters endowed with a facile tongue a fluent pen and an eye and ear of singular acuteness and delicacy distinguished for unflagging industry and singular aptitude for secret and intricate affairs he had by the exercise of these various qualities during a period of nearly twenty years at the court of henry the great been able to render inestimable services to the republic which he represented
he had enjoyed the intimacy and even the confidence of henry iv
so far as any man could be said to possess that monarch's confidence and his friendly relations and familiar access to the king gave him political advantages superior to those of any of his colleagues at the same court
acting entirely and faithfully according to the instructions of the advocate of holland he always gratefully and copiously acknowledged the privilege of being guided and sustained in the difficult paths he had to traverse by so powerful and active an intellect
i have seldom alluded in terms to the instructions and dispatches of the chief but every position negotiation and opinion of the envoy and the reader has seen many of them is pervaded by their spirit
it had become a question whether he was to remain at his post or return
it was doubtful whether he wished to be relieved of his embassy or not
the states of holland voted to leave it to his candid opinion if in his free conscience he thinks he can serve the public any longer
if yes he may keep his office one year more
if no he may take leave and come home
surely the states under the guidance of the advocate had thus acted with consummate courtesy towards a diplomatist whose position from no apparent fault of his own but by the force of circumstances and rather to his credit than otherwise was gravely compromised
the queen mary de medici had a talk with him got angry became very red in the face and wanted to be rid of him
nor was the envoy at first desirous of remaining
nevertheless he yielded reluctantly to barneveld's request that he should for the time at least remain at his post
later on as the intrigues against him began to unfold themselves and his faithful services were made use of at home to blacken his character and procure his removal he refused to resign as to do so would be to play into the hands of his enemies and by inference at least to accuse himself of infidelity to his trust
it is no wonder that the ambassador was galled to the quick by the outrage which those concerned in the government were seeking to put upon him
how could an honest man fail to be overwhelmed with rage and anguish at being dishonored before the world by his masters for scrupulously doing his duty and for maintaining the rights and dignity of his own country
he knew that the charges were but pretexts that the motives of his enemies were as base as the intrigues themselves but he also knew that the world usually sides with the government against the individual and that a man's reputation is rarely strong enough to maintain itself unsullied in a foreign land when his own government stretches forth its hand not to shield but to stab him
i know he said that this plot has been woven partly here in holland and partly here by good correspondence in order to drive me from my post
but as i have discovered this accurately i have resolved to offer to my masters the continuance of my very humble service for such time and under such conditions as they may think good to prescribe
i prefer forcing my natural and private inclinations to giving an opportunity for the ministers of this kingdom to discredit us and to my enemies to succeed in injuring me and by fraud and malice to force me from my post
i am truly sorry being ready to retire wishing to have an honorable testimony in recompense of my labors that one is in such hurry to take advantage of my fall
what envoy will ever dare to speak with vigor if he is not sustained by the government at home
my enemies have misrepresented my actions and my language as passionate exaggerated mischievous but i have no passion except for the service of my superiors
barneveld from well considered motives of public policy was favoring his honorable recall
but he allowed a decorous interval of more than three years to elapse in which to terminate his affairs and to take a deliberate departure from that french embassy to which the advocate had originally promoted him and in which there had been so many years of mutual benefit and confidence between the two statesmen
he used no underhand means
he did not abuse the power of the states general which he wielded to cast him suddenly and brutally from the distinguished post which he occupied and so to attempt to dishonor him before the world
nothing could be more respectful and conciliatory than the attitude of the government from first to last towards this distinguished functionary
the republic respected itself too much to deal with honorable agents whose services it felt obliged to dispense with as with vulgar malefactors who had been detected in crime
this work aims at being a political study
i would attempt to exemplify the influence of individual humors and passions some of them among the highest and others certainly the basest that agitate humanity upon the march of great events upon general historical results at certain epochs and upon the destiny of eminent personages
here are two suggestive portraits the advocate while acting only in the name of a slender confederacy was in truth so long as he held his place the prime minister of european protestantism
there was none other to rival him few to comprehend him fewer still to sustain him
as prince maurice was at that time the great soldier of protestantism without clearly scanning the grandeur of the field in which he was a chief actor or foreseeing the vastness of its future so the advocate was its statesman and its prophet
could the two have worked together as harmoniously as they had done at an earlier day it would have been a blessing for the common weal of europe
but alas the evil genius of jealousy which so often forbids cordial relations between soldier and statesman already stood shrouded in the distance darkly menacing the strenuous patriot who was wearing his life out in exertions for what he deemed the true cause of progress and humanity
all history shows that the brilliant soldier of a republic is apt to have the advantage in a struggle for popular affection and popular applause over the statesman however consummate
the great battles and sieges of the prince had been on a world's theatre had enchained the attention of christendom and on their issue had frequently depended or seemed to depend the very existence of the nation
the labors of the statesman on the contrary had been comparatively secret
his noble orations and arguments had been spoken with closed doors to assemblies of colleagues rather envoys than senators
while his vast labors in directing both the internal administration and especially the foreign affairs of the commonwealth had been by their very nature as secret as they were perpetual and enormous
the reader of the life of barneveld must judge for himself whether in these and similar passages the historian was thinking solely of maurice the great military leader of barneveld the great statesman and of aerssens the recalled ambassador
he will certainly find that there were burning questions for ministers to handle then as now and recognize in that visible atmosphere of power the poison of which it is so difficult to resist a respiratory medium as well known to the nineteenth as to the seventeenth century
60 63 death of mrs
motley last visit to america
illness and death lady harcourt's communication
on the last day of 1874 the beloved wife whose health had for some years been failing was taken from him by death
she had been the pride of his happier years the stay and solace of those which had so tried his sensitive spirit
the blow found him already weakened by mental suffering and bodily infirmity and he never recovered from it
mr motley's last visit to america was in the summer and autumn of 1875
during several weeks which he passed at nahant a seaside resort near boston i saw him almost daily
he walked feebly and with some little difficulty and complained of a feeling of great weight in the right arm which made writing laborious
his handwriting had not betrayed any very obvious change so far as i had noticed in his letters
his features and speech were without any paralytic character
his mind was clear except when as on one or two occasions he complained of some confused feeling and walked a few minutes in the open air to compose himself
his thoughts were always tending to revert to the almost worshipped companion from whom death had parted him a few months before
yet he could often be led away to other topics and in talking of them could be betrayed into momentary cheerfulness of manner
his long enduring and all pervading grief was not more a tribute to the virtues and graces of her whom he mourned than an evidence of the deeply affectionate nature which in other relations endeared him to so many whose friendship was a title to love and honor
i have now the privilege of once more recurring to the narrative of mr
the harassing work and mental distress of this time after the recall from england acting on an acutely nervous organization began the process of undermining his constitution of which we were so soon to see the results
it was not the least courageous act of his life that smarting under a fresh wound tired and unhappy he set his face immediately towards the accomplishment of fresh literary labor
after my sister's marriage in january he went to the hague to begin his researches in the archives for john of barneveld
the queen of the netherlands had made ready a house for us and personally superintended every preparation for his reception
we remained there until the spring and then removed to a house more immediately in the town a charming old fashioned mansion once lived in by john de witt where he had a large library and every domestic comfort during the year of his sojourn
the incessant literary labor in an enervating climate with enfeebled health may have prepared the way for the first break in his constitution which was to show itself soon after
there were many compensations in the life about him
he enjoyed the privilege of constant companionship with one of the warmest hearts and finest intellects which i have ever known in a woman the ame d'elite which has passed beyond this earth
the gracious sentiment with which the queen sought to express her sense of what holland owed him would have been deeply felt even had her personal friendship been less dear to us all
from the king the society of the hague and the diplomatic circle we had many marks of kindness
once or twice i made short journeys with him for change of air to amsterdam to look for the portraits of john of barneveld and his wife to bohemia where with the lingering hope of occupying himself with the thirty years war he looked carefully at the scene of wallenstein's death near prague and later to varzin in pomerania for a week with prince bismarck after the great events of the franco german war
in the autumn of 1872 we moved to england partly because it was evident that his health and my mother's required a change partly for private reasons to be near my sister and her children
the day after our arrival at bournemouth occurred the rupture of a vessel on the lungs without any apparently sufficient cause
he recovered enough to revise and complete his manuscript and we thought him better when at the end of july in london he was struck down by the first attack of the head which robbed him of all after power of work although the intellect remained untouched
sir william gull sent him to cannes for the winter where he was seized with a violent internal inflammation in which i suppose there was again the indication of the lesion of blood vessels
i am nearing the shadow now the time of which i can hardly bear to write
you know the terrible sorrow which crushed him on the last day of 1874 the grief which broke his heart and from which he never rallied
from that day it seems to me that his life may be summed up in the two words patient waiting
never for one hour did her spirit leave him and he strove to follow its leading for the short and evil days left and the hope of the life beyond
i think i have never watched quietly and reverently the traces of one personal character remaining so strongly impressed on another nature
with herself depreciation and unselfishness she would have been the last to believe how much of him was in her very existence nor could we have realized it until the parting came
henceforward with the mind still there but with the machinery necessary to set it in motion disturbed and shattered he could but try to create small occupations with which to fill the hours of a life which was only valued for his children's sake
kind and loving friends in england and america soothed the passage and our gratitude for so many gracious acts is deep and true
his love for children always a strong feeling was gratified by the constant presence of my sister's babies the eldest a little girl who bore my mother's name and had been her idol being the companion of many hours and his best comforter
at the end the blow came swiftly and suddenly as he would have wished it
it was a terrible shock to us who had vainly hoped to keep him a few years longer but at least he was spared what he had dreaded with a great dread a gradual failure of mental or bodily power
the mind was never clouded the affections never weakened and after a few hours of unconscious physical struggle he lay at rest his face beautiful and calm without a trace of suffering or illness
once or twice he said it has come it has come and there were a few broken words before consciousness fled but there was little time for messages or leave taking
by a strange coincidence his life ended near the town of dorchester in the mother country as if the last hour brought with it a reminiscence of his birthplace and of his own dearly loved mother
by his own wish only the dates of his birth and death appear upon his gravestone with the text chosen by himself in god is light and in him is no darkness at all
xxiv conclusion his character
in closing this restricted and imperfect record of a life which merits and in due time will i trust receive an ampler tribute i cannot refrain from adding a few thoughts which naturally suggest themselves and some of which may seem quite unnecessary to the reader who has followed the story of the historian and diplomatist's brilliant and eventful career
mr motley came of a parentage which promised the gifts of mind and body very generally to be accounted for in a measure at least wherever we find them by the blood of one or both of the parents
they gave him special attractions and laid him open to not a few temptations
too many young men born to shine in social life to sparkle it may be in conversation perhaps in the lighter walks of literature become agreeable idlers self indulgent frivolous incapable of large designs or sustained effort lose every aspiration and forget every ideal
our gilded youth want such examples as this of motley not a solitary but a conspicuous one to teach them how much better is the restlessness of a noble ambition than the narcotized stupor of club life or the vapid amusement of a dressed up intercourse which too often requires a questionable flavor of forbidden license to render it endurable to persons of vivacious character and temperament
it would seem difficult for a man so flattered from his earliest days to be modest in his self estimate but motley was never satisfied with himself
he was impulsive and was occasionally i have heard it said over excited when his prejudices were roughly handled
in all that related to the questions involved in our civil war he was no doubt very sensitive
he had heard so much that exasperated him in the foreign society which he had expected to be in full sympathy with the cause of liberty as against slavery that he might be excused if he showed impatience when he met with similar sentiments among his own countrymen
he felt that he had been cruelly treated by his own government and no one who conceives himself to have been wronged and insulted must be expected to reason in naked syllogisms on the propriety of the liberties which have been taken with his name and standing
but with all his quickness of feeling his manners were easy and courteous simply because his nature was warm and kindly and with all his natural fastidiousness there was nothing of the coxcomb about him
he must have had enemies as all men of striking individuality are sure to have his presence cast more uncouth patriots into the shade his learning was a reproach to the ignorant his fame was too bright a distinction his high bred air and refinement which he could not help would hardly commend him to the average citizen in an order of things in which mediocrity is at a premium and the natural nobility of presence which rarely comes without family antecedents to account for it is not always agreeable to the many whose two ideals are the man on horseback and the man in his shirt sleeves
it may well be questioned whether washington with his grand manner would be nearly as popular with what are called the masses as lincoln with his homely ways and broad stories
the experiment of universal suffrage must render the waters of political and social life more or less turbid even if they remain innoxious
the cloaca maxima can hardly mingle its contents with the stream of the aqua claudia without taking something from its crystal clearness
we need not go so far as one of our well known politicians has recently gone in saying that no great man can reach the highest position in our government but we can safely say that apart from military fame the loftiest and purest and finest personal qualities are not those which can be most depended upon at the ballot box
strange stories are told of avowed opposition to mr
motley on the ground of the most trivial differences in point of taste in personal matters so told that it is hard to disbelieve them and they show that the caprices which we might have thought belonged exclusively to absolute rulers among their mistresses or their minions may be felt in the councils of a great people which calls itself self governing
it is perfectly true that mr
motley did not illustrate the popular type of politician
he was too high minded too scholarly too generously industrious too polished too much at home in the highest european circles too much courted for his personal fascinations too remote from the trading world of caucus managers
to degrade him so far as official capital punishment could do it was not merely to wrong one whom the nation should have delighted to honor as showing it to the world in the fairest flower of its young civilization but it was an indignity to a representative of the highest scholarship of native growth which every student in the land felt as a discouragement to all sound learning and noble ambition
if he was disappointed in his diplomatic career he had enough and more than enough to console him in his brilliant literary triumphs
he had earned them all by the most faithful and patient labor
if he had not the frame of adamant of the swedish hero he had his soul of fire
no labors could tire him no difficulties affright him
what most surprised those who knew him as a young man was not his ambition not his brilliancy but his dogged continuous capacity for work
we have seen with what astonishment the old dutch scholar groen van prinsterer looked upon a man who had wrestled with authors like bor and van meteren who had grappled with the mightiest folios and toiled undiscouraged among half illegible manuscript records
having spared no pains in collecting his materials he told his story as we all know with flowing ease and stirring vitality
his views may have been more or less partial philip the second may have deserved the pitying benevolence of poor maximilian maurice may have wept as sincerely over the errors of arminius as any one of the crocodile crew that believe in election barneveld and grotius may have been on the road to rome none of these things seem probable but if they were all proved true in opposition to his views we should still have the long roll of glowing tapestry he has woven for us with all its life like portraits its almost moving pageants its sieges where we can see the artillery flashing its battle fields with their smoke and fire pictures which cannot fade and which will preserve his name interwoven with their own enduring colors
republics are said to be ungrateful it might be truer to say that they are forgetful
they forgive those who have wronged them as easily as they forget those who have done them good service
but history never forgets and never forgives
to her decision we may trust the question whether the warm hearted patriot who had stood up for his country nobly and manfully in the hour of trial the great scholar and writer who had reflected honor upon her throughout the world of letters the high minded public servant whose shortcomings it taxed the ingenuity of experts to make conspicuous enough to be presentable was treated as such a citizen should have been dealt with
his record is safe in her hands and his memory will be precious always in the hearts of all who enjoyed his friendship
this club of which we were both members and which is still flourishing came into existence in a very quiet sort of way at about the same time as the atlantic monthly and although entirely unconnected with that magazine included as members some of its chief contributors
of those who might have been met at some of the monthly gatherings in its earlier days i may mention emerson hawthorne longfellow lowell motley whipple whittier professors agassiz and peirce john s
dana junior charles sumner
it offered a wide gamut of intelligences and the meetings were noteworthy occasions
if there was not a certain amount of mutual admiration among some of those i have mentioned it was a great pity and implied a defect in the nature of men who were otherwise largely endowed
the vitality of this club has depended in a great measure on its utter poverty in statutes and by laws its entire absence of formality and its blessed freedom from speech making
that holy man richard baxter says in his preface to alleine's alarm i have done when i have sought to remove a little scandal which i foresaw that i should myself write the preface to his life where himself and two of his friends make such a mention of my name which i cannot own which will seem a praising him for praising me
i confess it looketh ill favoredly in me
but i had not the power of other men's writings and durst not forbear that which was his due
i do not know that i have any occasion for a similar apology in printing the following lines read at a meeting of members of the saturday club and other friends who came together to bid farewell to motley before his return to europe in 1857
a parting health yes we knew we must lose him though friendship may claim to blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame though fondly at parting we call him our own t is the whisper of love when the bugle has blown
as the rider that rests with the spur on his heel as the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steel as the archer that stands with his shaft on the string he stoops from his toil to the garland we bring
what pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom while the tapestry lengthens the life glowing dyes that caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies
in the alcoves of death in the charnels of time where flit the dark spectres of passion and crime there are triumphs untold there are martyrs unsung there are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue
let us hear the proud story that time has bequeathed from lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed
let him summon its tyrants and tell us their doom though he sweep the black past like van tromp with his broom
the dream flashes by for the west winds awake on pampas on prairie o'er mountain and lake to bathe the swift bark like a sea girdled shrine with incense they stole from the rose and the pine
so fill a bright cup with the sunlight that gushed when the dead summer's jewels were trampled and crushed the true knight of learning the world holds him dear love bless him joy crown him god speed his career
b habits and methods of study
mr motley's daughter lady harcourt has favored me with many interesting particulars which i could not have learned except from a member of his own family
her description of his way of living and of working will be best given in her own words he generally rose early the hour varying somewhat at different parts of his life according to his work and health
sometimes when much absorbed by literary labor he would rise before seven often lighting his own fire and with a cup of tea or coffee writing until the family breakfast hour after which his work was immediately resumed and he usually sat over his writing table until late in the afternoon when he would take a short walk
his dinner hour was late and he rarely worked at night
during the early years of his literary studies he led a life of great retirement
later after the publication of the dutch republic and during the years of official place he was much in society in england austria and holland
he enjoyed social life and particularly dining out keenly but was very moderate and simple in all his personal habits and for many years before his death had entirely given up smoking
his work when not in his own library was in the archives of the netherlands brussels paris the english state paper office and the british museum where he made his own researches patiently and laboriously consulting original manuscripts and reading masses of correspondence from which he afterwards sometimes caused copies to be made and where he worked for many consecutive hours a day
after his material had been thus painfully and toilfully amassed the writing of his own story was always done at home and his mind having digested the necessary matter always poured itself forth in writing so copiously that his revision was chiefly devoted to reducing the over abundance
he never shrank from any of the drudgery of preparation but i think his own part of the work was sheer pleasure to him
i should have mentioned that his residence in london while minister was at the house no
17 arlington street belonging to lord yarborough
c sir william gull's account of his illness
i have availed myself of the permission implied in the subjoined letter of sir william gull to make large extracts from his account of mr
motley's condition while under his medical care
in his earlier years he had often complained to me of those nervous feelings connected with the respiration referred to by this very distinguished physician
i do not remember any other habitual trouble to which he was subject
february 13 1878 my dear sir i send the notes of mr
motley's last illness as i promised
they are too technical for general readers but you will make such exception as you require
the medical details may interest your professional friends
mr motley's case was a striking illustration that the renal disease of so called bright's disease may supervene as part and parcel of a larger and antecedent change in the blood vessels in other parts than the kidney
i am my dear sir yours very truly william w
gull to oliver wendell holmes esq
i first saw mr
motley i believe about the year 1870 on account of some nervous feelings connected with the respiration
at that time his general health was good and all he complained of was occasionally a feeling of oppression about the chest
there were no physical signs of anything abnormal and the symptoms quite passed away in the course of time and with the use of simple antispasmodic remedies such as camphor and the like
this was my first interview with mr
motley and i was naturally glad to have the opportunity of making his acquaintance
i remember that in our conversation i jokingly said that my wife could hardly forgive him for not making her hero henri iv
a perfect character and the earnestness with which he replied au serieux i assure you i have fairly recorded the facts
after this date i did not see mr
motley for some time
he had three slight attacks of haemoptysis in the autumn of 1872 but no physical signs of change in the lung tissue resulted
so early as this i noticed that there were signs of commencing thickening in the heart as shown by the degree and extent of its impulse
the condition of his health though at that time not very obviously failing a good deal arrested my attention as i thought i could perceive in the occurrence of the haemoptysis and in the cardiac hypertrophy the early beginnings of vascular degeneration
in august 1873 occurred the remarkable seizure from the effects of which mr
motley never recovered i did not see him in the attack but was informed as far as i can remember that he was on a casual visit at a friend's house at luncheon or it might have been dinner when he suddenly became strangely excited but not quite unconscious
i believed at the time and do so still that there was some capillary apoplexy of the convolutions
the attack was attended with some hemiplegic weakness on the right side and altered sensation and ever after there was a want of freedom and ease both in the gait and in the use of the arm of that side
to my inquiries from time to time how the arm was the patient would always flex and extend it freely but nearly always used the expression there is a bedevilment in it though the handwriting was not much if at all altered
in december 1873 mr
motley went by my advice to cannes
i wrote the following letter at the time to my friend dr
frank who was practising there this letter every word of which was of value to the practitioner who was to have charge of the patient relates many of the facts given above and i shall therefore only give extracts from it
december 29 1873 my dear dr
frank my friend mr
motley the historian and late american minister whose name and fame no doubt you know very well has by my advice come to cannes for the winter and spring and i have promised him to give you some account of his case
to me it is one of special interest and personally as respects the subject of it of painful interest
i have known mr
motley for some time but he consulted me for the present condition about midsummer
if i have formed a correct opinion of the pathology of the case i believe the smaller vessels are degenerating in several parts of the vascular area lung brain and kidneys
with this view i have suggested a change of climate a nourishing diet etc
and it is to be hoped and i trust expected that by great attention to the conditions of hygiene internal and external the progress of degeneration may be retarded
i have no doubt you will find as time goes on increasing evidence of renal change but this is rather a coincidence and consequence than a cause though no doubt when the renal change has reached a certain point it becomes in its own way a factor of other lesions
i have troubled you at this length because my mind is much occupied with the pathology of these cases and because no case can on personal grounds more strongly challenge our attention
yours very truly william w
gull during the spring of 1874 whilst at cannes mr
motley had a sharp attack of nephritis attended with fever but on returning to england in july there was no important change in the health
the weakness of the side continued and the inability to undertake any mental work
the signs of cardiac hypertrophy were more distinct
in the beginning of the year 1875 i wrote as follows february 20 1875
my dear mr motley
the examination i have just made appears to indicate that the main conditions of your health are more stable than they were some months ago and would therefore be so far in favor of your going to america in the summer as we talked of
the ground of my doubt has lain in the possibility of such a trip further disordering the circulation
of this i hope there is now less risk
on the 4th of june 1875 i received the following letter calverly park hotel tunbridge wells june 4 1875
my dear sir william i have been absent from town for a long time but am to be there on the 9th and 10th
could i make an appointment with you for either of those days
i am anxious to have a full consultation with you before leaving for america
our departure is fixed for the 19th of this month
i have not been worse than usual of late
i think myself on the contrary rather stronger and it is almost impossible for me not to make my visit to america this summer unless you should absolutely prohibit it
if neither of those days should suit you could you kindly suggest another day
i hope however you can spare me half an hour on one of those days as i like to get as much of this bracing air as i can
will you kindly name the hour when i may call on you and address me at this hotel
excuse this slovenly note in pencil but it fatigues my head and arm much more to sit at a writing table with pen and ink
always most sincerely yours my dear sir william j
l motley on mr
motley's return from america i saw him and found him i thought rather better in general health than when he left england
in december 1875 mr
motley consulted me for trouble of vision in reading or walking from sensations like those produced by flakes of falling snow coming between him and the objects he was looking at
mr bowman one of our most excellent oculists was then consulted
mr bowman wrote to me as follows such symptoms as exist point rather to disturbed retinal function than to any brain mischief
it is however quite likely that what you fear for the brain may have had its counterpart in the nerve structures of the eye and as he is short sighted this tendency may be further intensified
mr bowman suggested no more than such an arrangement of glasses as might put the eyes when in use under better optic conditions
the year 1876 was passed over without any special change worth notice
the walking powers were much impeded by the want of control over the right leg
the mind was entirely clear though mr
motley did not feel equal and indeed had been advised not to apply himself to any literary work
occasional conversations when i had interviews with him on the subject of his health proved that the attack which had weakened the movements of the right side had not impaired the mental power
the most noticeable change which had come over mr
motley since i first knew him was due to the death of mrs
it had in fact not only profoundly depressed him but if i may so express it had removed the centre of his thought to a new world
in long conversations with me of a speculative kind after that painful event it was plain how much his point of view of the whole course and relation of things had changed
his mind was the last to dogmatize on any subject
there was a candid and childlike desire to know with an equal confession of the incapacity of the human intellect
i wish i could recall the actual expressions he used but the sense was that which has been so well stated by hooker in concluding an exhortation against the pride of the human intellect where he remarks dangerous it were for the feeble brain of man to wade far into the doings of the most high whom although to know be life and joy to make mention of his name yet our soundest knowledge is to know that we know him not indeed as he is neither can know him and our safest eloquence concerning him is our silence when we confess without confession that his glory is inexplicable his greatness above our capacity and reach
he is above and we upon earth therefore it behoveth our words to be wary and few
mrs motley's illness was not a long one and the nature of it was such that its course could with certainty be predicted
mr motley and her children passed the remaining days of her life extending over about a month with her in the mutual under standing that she was soon to part from them
the character of the illness and the natural exhaustion of her strength by suffering lessened the shock of her death though not the loss to those who survived her
the last time i saw mr
motley was i believe about two months before his death march 28 1877
there was no great change in his health but he complained of indescribable sensations in his nervous system and felt as if losing the whole power of walking but this was not obvious in his gait although he walked shorter distances than before
i heard no more of him until i was suddenly summoned on the 29th of may into devonshire to see him
the telegram i received was so urgent that i suspected some rupture of a blood vessel in the brain and that i should hardly reach him alive and this was the case
about two o'clock in the day he complained of a feeling of faintness said he felt ill and should not recover and in a few minutes was insensible with symptoms of ingravescent apoplexy
there was extensive haemorrhage into the brain as shown by post mortem examination the cerebral vessels being atheromatous
the fatal haemorrhage had occurred into the lateral ventricles from rupture of one of the middle cerebral arteries
gull e from the proceedings of the massachusetts society
at a meeting of the massachusetts historical society held on thursday the 14th of june 1877 after the reading of the records of the preceding meeting the president the hon
robert c winthrop spoke as follows our first thoughts to day gentlemen are of those whom we may not again welcome to these halls
we shall be in no mood certainly for entering on other subjects this morning until we have given some expression to our deep sense of the loss the double loss which our society has sustained since our last monthly meeting
edmund quincy died may 17
john lothrop motley died may 29
after a most interesting and cordial tribute to his friend mr
quincy mr winthrop continued the death of our distinguished associate motley can hardly have taken many of us by surprise
sudden at the moment of its occurrence we had long been more or less prepared for it by his failing health
it must indeed have been quite too evident to those who had seen him during the last two or three years that his life work was finished
i think he so regarded it himself
hopes may have been occasionally revived in the hearts of his friends and even in his own heart that his long cherished purpose of completing a history of the thirty years war as the grand consummation of his historical labors for which all his other volumes seemed to him to have been but the preludes and overtures might still be accomplished
but such hopes faint and flickering from his first attack had well nigh died away
they were like prescott's hopes of completing his philip the second or like macaulay's hopes of finishing his brilliant history of england
but great as may be the loss to literature of such a crowning work from motley's pen it was by no means necessary to the completeness of his own fame
his rise of the dutch republic his history of the united netherlands and his life of john of barneveld had abundantly established his reputation and given him a fixed place among the most eminent historians of our country and of our age
no american writer certainly has secured a wider recognition or a higher appreciation from the scholars of the old world
the universities of england and the learned societies of europe have bestowed upon him their largest honors
it happened to me to be in paris when he was first chosen a corresponding member of the institute and when his claims were canvassed with the freedom and earnestness which peculiarly characterize such a candidacy in france
there was no mistaking the profound impression which his first work had made on the minds of such men as guizot and mignet
within a year or two past a still higher honor has been awarded him from the same source
the journals not long ago announced his election as one of the six foreign associates of the french academy of moral and political sciences a distinction which prescott would probably have attained had he lived a few years longer until there was a vacancy but which as a matter of fact i believe motley was the only american writer except the late edward livingston of louisiana who has actually enjoyed
residing much abroad for the purpose of pursuing his historical researches he had become the associate and friend of the most eminent literary men in almost all parts of the world and the singular charms of his conversation and manners had made him a favorite guest in the most refined and exalted circles
of his relations to political and public life this is hardly the occasion or the moment for speaking in detail
misconstructions and injustices are the proverbial lot of those who occupy eminent position
it was a duke of vienna if i remember rightly whom shakespeare in his measure for measure introduces as exclaiming o place and greatness millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee
volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quests upon thy doings
thousand stapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dream and rack thee in their fancies
i forbear from all application of the lines
it is enough for me certainly to say here to day that our country was proud to be represented at the courts of vienna and london successively by a gentleman of so much culture and accomplishment as mr
motley and that the circumstances of his recall were deeply regretted by us all
his fame however was quite beyond the reach of any such accidents and could neither be enhanced nor impaired by appointments or removals
as a powerful and brilliant historian we pay him our unanimous tribute of admiration and regret and give him a place in our memories by the side of prescott and irving
i do not forget how many of us lament him also as a cherished friend
he died on the 29th ultimo at the house of his daughter mrs
sheridan in dorsetshire england and an impressive tribute to his memory was paid in westminster abbey on the following sunday by our honorary member dean stanley
such a tribute from such lips and with such surroundings leaves nothing to be desired in the way of eulogy
he was buried in kensal green cemetery by the side of his beloved wife
one might well say of motley precisely what he said of prescott in a letter from rome to our associate mr
william amory immediately on hearing of prescott's death i feel inexpressibly disappointed speaking now for an instant purely from a literary point of view that the noble and crowning monument of his life for which he had laid such massive foundations and the structure of which had been carried forward in such a grand and masterly manner must remain uncompleted like the unfinished peristyle of some stately and beautiful temple on which the night of time has suddenly descended
but still the works which his great and untiring hand had already thoroughly finished will remain to attest his learning and genius a precious and perpetual possession for his country
the president now called on dr
oliver wendell holmes who said the thoughts which suggest themselves upon this occasion are such as belong to the personal memories of the dear friends whom we have lost rather than to their literary labors the just tribute to which must wait for a calmer hour than the present following so closely as it does on our bereavement
his first literary venture of any note was the story called morton's hope or the memoirs of a provincial
this first effort failed to satisfy the critics the public or himself
his personality pervaded the characters and times which he portrayed so that there was a discord between the actor and his costume
brilliant passages could not save it and it was plain enough that he must ripen into something better before the world would give him the reception which surely awaited him if he should find his true destination
the early failures of a great writer are like the first sketches of a great artist and well reward patient study
more than this the first efforts of poets and story tellers are very commonly palimpsests beneath the rhymes or the fiction one can almost always spell out the characters which betray the writer's self
take these passages from the story just referred to ah
flattery is a sweet and intoxicating potion whether we drink it from an earthen ewer or a golden chalice
flattery from man to woman is expected it is a part of the courtesy of society but when the divinity descends from the altar to burn incense to the priest what wonder if the idolater should feel himself transformed into a god
he had run the risk of being spoiled but he had a safeguard in his aspirations
my ambitious anticipations says morton in the story were as boundless as they were various and conflicting
as a warrior i would conquer and overrun the world as a statesman i would reorganize and govern it as a historian i would consign it all to immortality and in my leisure moments i would be a great poet and a man of the world
who can doubt that in this passage of his story he is picturing his own visions one of the fairest of which was destined to become reality
but there was another element in his character which those who knew him best recognized as one with which he had to struggle hard that is a modesty which sometimes tended to collapse into self distrust
this too betrays itself in the sentences which follow those just quoted in short says morton i was already enrolled in that large category of what are called young men of genius
men of whom unheard of things are expected till after long preparation comes a portentous failure and then they are forgotten
they are all disappointments
the president appointed professor lowell to write the memoir of mr
quincy and dr holmes that of mr
professor william everett then spoke as follows there is one incident sir in mr
motley's career that has not been mentioned to day which is perhaps most vividly remembered by those of us who were in europe at the outbreak of our civil war in 1861
at that time the ignorance of englishmen friendly or otherwise about america was infinite they knew very little of us and that little wrong
americans were overwhelmed with questions taunts threats misrepresentations the outgrowth of ignorance and ignoring worse than ignorance from every class of englishmen
never was an authoritative exposition of our hopes and policy worse needed and there was no one to do it
the outgoing diplomatic agents represented a bygone order of things the representatives of mr
lincoln's administration had not come
at that time of anxiety mr
motley living in england as a private person came forward with two letters in the times which set forth the cause of the united states once and for all
no unofficial and few official men could have spoken with such authority and been so certain of obtaining a hearing from englishmen
thereafter amid all the clouds of falsehood and ridicule which we had to encounter there was one lighthouse fixed on a rock to which we could go for foothold from which we could not be driven and against which all assaults were impotent
there can be no question that the effect produced by these letters helped if help had been needed to point out mr
motley as a candidate for high diplomatic place who could not be overlooked
their value was recognized alike by his fellow citizens in america and his admirers in england but none valued them more than the little band of exiles who were struggling against terrible odds and who rejoiced with a great joy to see the stars and stripes whose centennial anniversary those guns are now celebrating planted by a hand so truly worthy to rally every american to its support
i cannot close this memoir more appropriately than by appending the following poetical tribute in memory of john lothrop motley
sleep motley with the great of ancient days who wrote for all the years that yet shall be
sleep with herodotus whose name and praise have reached the isles of earth's remotest sea
sleep while defiant of the slow delays of time thy glorious writings speak for thee and in the answering heart of millions raise the generous zeal for right and liberty
and should the days o'ertake us when at last the silence that ere yet a human pen had traced the slenderest record of the past hushed the primeval languages of men upon our english tongue its spell shall cast thy memory shall perish only then

value of smell although the sense of smell is not so acute in man as in some of the lower animals it is nevertheless a most important and useful gift
1 a healthy condition of our animal life is as we know most important for the healthy condition of our spiritual life and we dare never ignore the animal life so long as we are not quit of it
further would not in this case the most perfect knowledge of his economy be demanded of the animal man would not the child need to be a master in a branch of knowledge in which after fifty years of investigation harvey boerhaave and haller were only beginners
this is one of the lines of separation between man and the animal
the part accordingly played by thought in the case of a mental perception is here taken up by that modification in the animal parts of us which either threatens the destruction of the sensation or insures its duration that is an eternal law of wisdom has combined with that condition of the machine which confirms its welfare a pleasant emotion of the soul and on the other hand with that condition which undermines it and threatens ruin an unpleasant emotion is connected and this in such a manner that the sensation itself has not the faintest resemblance to the state of the organs of which it is the mark
man too lives an animal life is sensible of its pleasures and suffers its pains
this is not yet all
the first class embraces those which no known laws and phenomena of the physical world enable us to comprehend and to these belong the sensibility of the nerves and the irritability of the muscles
s 4 animal life
now we have animal life
s 5 animal sensations
1 but we have something more than the animal life of the animal beast
it must therefore possess a firm foundation not easily moved that is the soul must be fitted and prepared for the actions of our bodily life by an irresistible power
these sensations if they are not exactly the expression of the present state of our organs mark it out specifically or better accompany it
it experiences pleasant sensations that it may preserve the animal life
but why he feels and suffers that he may preserve his animal life
these two principles go to form the specific character of animal organism
a beast lives an animal life in order that it may experience pleasant sensations
he preserves his animal life that he may longer have the power to live a spiritual one
vegetation then and animal mechanism thoroughly mingled form the proper physical life of the human body
animal sensations have on this showing a double origin 1 in the present state of the machine 2 in the capacity or faculty of sensation
were then the sensations of our animal loss or well being to become spiritual perceptions and had they to be created by thought how often would the soul be obscured by the overwhelming blaze of passion how often stifled by laziness and stupidity how often overlooked in the absorptions and distractions of business
it is the only sense that responds to matter in the gaseous state and is for this reason the only natural means of detecting harmful constituents of the atmosphere
here then the means differ from the end there end and means seem to coincide
the organic powers of the human body naturally divide themselves into two principal classes
these sensations have quickly and forcibly to determine the will to aversion or desire but on the other hand they are ever to float on the surface of the soul and never to extend to the province of the reason
the soul must therefore be conscious of the present evil or good state of its organs from a bad state it must draw dissatisfaction from a good state satisfaction so that it may either retain or remove the condition seek it or fly from it
further since the body is subjected to all the consequences of this connection and in the circle of circumstances is exposed to countless hostile forces it must be within the power of the soul to protect the body against these harmful influences and to bring it into such relations with the physical world as shall tend most to its preservation
in this connection it has been likened to a sentinel standing guard over the air passages
many gases are however without odor and for this reason cannot be detected by the nostrils
it is of especial importance that gases which are likely to become mixed with the air supply to the body have odor even though the odor be disagreeable
how shall she become acquainted with it
among these i reckon the mechanism of motion and the chemistry of the human body the source of vegetable life
here then we have the organism at once and closely linked to the sensational capacity and the soul drawn into the service of the body
the bad odors of illuminating gas and of various compounds of the chemical laboratory since they serve as danger signals to put one exposed to them on his guard are of great protective value
sight and hearing the sense organs of sight and hearing are highly complicated structures and will be considered in the chapters following
inasmuch as it has hitherto been impossible to penetrate the economy of the invisible men have sought to interpret this unknown mechanism through that with which they were already familiar and have considered the nerves as a canal conducting an excessively fine volatile and active fluid which in rapidity of motion and fineness was held to excel ether and the electric spark
but it is a simple an uncertain happiness which depends upon the action of the organism it is a slave to luck and blind chance because it consists in sensation only
summary sensations are certain activities of the mind that result from excitations within the body or at its surface
further the irritability of the muscles was held to consist in a certain effort to contract themselves on the touch of some external provocation
since loss or misfortune when it occurs falls more or less within the will power of the spirit the spirit must be able to make some compensation for it
so far we have met with such sensations only as they take their rise in an antecedent operation of the understanding but we have now to deal with sensations in which the understanding bears no part
that advantage either connected by law in the case is of the duration is accordingly played up by that action in the modification parts lead of us which here undermines the ruin of this welfare or insures its condition the is and an manner of wisdom has taken with that sensation of the destruction which threatens its emotion the hand of the emotion and on the thought with the sensation which threatens it and confirms mark the soul is combined and do a smell in the a purpose that the sense itself has not such faintest perception to the resemblance of the organs of which it is a animal
the soul could thus have positively no idea of the condition she was called upon to alter
the second class of powers embraces those which we can account for by the universally known laws of physics
spread out the mesentery from the intestine of a cat and hold it between the eye and the light pacinian corpuscles will appear as small translucent bodies having the general form of grains of wheat
secure a portion of the mesentery over a circular opening in a thin piece of cork and examine it with a microscope of low power
this fluid was held to be the principle and author of our sensibility and power of motion and hence received the name of the spirit of life
follow the course of the nerve fiber to the nerve from which it branches
we have now something more than vegetation something more than a dead model and the mechanism of nerves and muscles
to show relative sensitiveness of different parts of the skin
holding a bristle between the fingers bring the end in contact with the skin noting the amount of pressure necessary to cause a sensation of touch
test the lips tongue tips of fingers and palm and back of hand trying different sizes of bristles
has the degree of sensitiveness any relation to the thickness of the cuticle
to show perceptive differences of different portions of the skin
place the points of a pair of dividers on the back of the hand of one who looks in the opposite direction
is one point felt or two

and xavier's vehement threats and commands to the others to be silent did not produce a calm
while their grandmother could only see oliver on the best side james and isabel could only see him on the worst and lost the greatness of the design in the mercenary habits that exclusive perseverance in it had produced
frost a cry of friendly recognition for her husband had planted them but they had not taken kindly to the soil and fifty years had produced but a starveling growth
he said in answer to their astonished greetings producing a note which was eagerly read dearest jem my uncle says i may write to you in case you can leave isabel that he will be glad to see you
but to the delight of the school room the chapel in the valley was produced in a complete form and a very pretty romance it was but the hermit and the brilliant denouement were quite a shock to the young ladies just when their tears were prepared and virginia was almost angry
pgdp.net this book was produced from scanned images of public domain material from the google print project
it was rudely built and only the part near the hearth was lined with matting the table and the few stools and chairs were rough carpentry chiefly made out of boxes but upon the wall hung a beautiful print from raffaelle of which she knew the giver as surely as if his name had been written on it and the small bookcase suspended near contained compressed together an epitome of louis's tastes the choicest of all his favourites in each class of book
i will send up some books for them to make an opening said mary
we ask her whether she projects a sketch of the paris revolution said clara laughing
and jane gave charlotte infinite injunctions varying from due care of the chaney images to reserve with mankind
he stepped in doors brought out a book and when mrs
i'll do the exercises pulling the copy books away
i want to talk over madame neckar's book with you miss king
james and isabel spent a pleasant lively christmas with their hospitable old friends and james returned full of fresh vigour and new projects
the voyage was over the ship was anchored boats were coming offshore the luggage was being hoisted out of the hold the passengers were congregated on deck eager to land some gazing with curious and enterprising eyes on the new country others scanning every boat in hopes of meeting a familiar face
the earl returned thanks on behalf of his aunt and said a great deal that could have come from the mouth of no one unaccustomed to public speaking ending by proposing the health of mr
it was the letters that mary had written to her aunt since the parting and the spanish books which she had left in her charge
mary sent him away very happy with some books for them some new spanish reading for himself an astronomical book and her little celestial globe for the whole firmament of stars had been by no means lost on him
to appear in public with rosita was the tribute for which mary had come out so she readily agreed and thereupon the senora digressed into the subject of dress and required of mary a display of all her robes and an account of the newest fashions of the english ladies
after the first course there was a long interval during which isabel and louis composedly talked about the public meeting which he had been attending and james fidgetted in the nervousness of hardly restrained displeasure but suddenly a frightful shrieking arose and he indignantly cried that girl
but she was almost ashamed to enjoy her extra hour's repose and then the leisurely breakfast nay even the hot rolls and clear coffee were appreciated and she sighed as she called up the image of the breakfast over an hour ago the grim kettle the bad butter the worse fire and james cold and hurried with kitty on his knee gnawing a lump of crust
if the day was no better than a weary turmoil save when his voice was in her ear his eyes wistfully bent on her the more carefully did she restrain all expression of hope of seeing him to morrow lest she should be exacting and detain him from projects of his own
he wrote the most magnificent descriptions of cheveleigh and insisted that his mother and clara should come and take possession on the eightieth birthday of the former the 14th of september and isabel was recovering so rapidly that there was nothing to oppose to his project although the new catharine would be scarcely three weeks old by that time
she had many hours to herself and she unpacked her books and set herself courses of study to which louis had opened the door
and i'll tell you what i'll seal up his fine red book and all his verses and you shall leave them in london as you go through with my compliments
while we were riding she used to sit with her dear old big bible and the two or three old books she was so fond of
my father is gone to the book club meeting so i thought we would try to revive old times he said smiling but sadly for the present scene was little like the no
only once did she go any deeper and that was as she took up a little book of religious poetry of which she had been very fond
i've taken my book and got out of earshot of the noise the blacks make and i do assure you miss ponsonby the stillness was enough to drive one wild with nothing but savage rocks to look at either
charlotte was sadly forlorn and shut herself up in her pantry or in her own little attic with jane's verbenas which cook had banished from the kitchen and lost her sorrows in books hired at the library
jem was bemoaning himself about having nothing to give to the new blind asylum and the next evening isabel brought out the prettiest little manuscript book tied with blue ribbon and told him to do as he pleased with it
no he thought not often he had generally worked hard enough in the week to make his book the best company but he liked now and then to see something green for a change after these bare mountains and rocks and the old don manrique was very civil and agreeable
she recked nothing of their keeping aloof her book and her pen were far pleasanter companions on her alternate evenings of solitude and in them she tried to lose her wishes for the merry days spent with granny and clara and her occasional perceptions that all was not as in their time
he was reluctant to leave off when the gentlemen appeared but isabel shut him up and quietly held out the portfolio to james who put it on the side table and began to clear the books away and restore some sort of order but it was a task beyond his efforts
rosita began to repent of having come near so horrible a place and when she put her head out of her litter and beheld herself winding along a ledge projecting from the face of a sheer precipice she would have begged to go back instantly but her husband spoke in a voice of authority which subdued her she drew in her head into her basket work contrivance and had recourse to vows to sta rosa of lima of a chaplet of diamond roses if she ever came safely down again
she almost felt it so herself so entirely did she fit into the old habits the little quiet dinner only it seemed unusually good the subsequent closing round the fire with the addition of miss king and louisa the easy desultory chat the books with mudie's stamp lying about the music which must be practised
5 books were on the sofa the table cover hung awry the dresden shepherd's hat was grimed and his damsel's sprigged gown hemmed with dust there were no flowers in the vases which his aunt had never left unsupplied and isabel though she could not be otherwise than handsome and refined had her crape rumpled and the heavy folds of her dark hair looking quite ready for the evening toilette and as she sat on her low seat by the fire the whole had an indescribable air of comfort passing into listless indulgence
illustration miss fanny and others
i hope my daughter fanny may put you a little mind of her
and yet that dear sister fanny of yours gone many years since ma'am
but she is a wise woman and will not bring her pretty fanny into our world and when i press her behold
williams the same impression of the illustrated london news which delighted jane beckett's simple heart in england caused no small sensation at lima
fitzjocelyn you never had any feelings yourself and therefore you trifle with those of others
if jane excels in one art before all others it is in mutton broth
miss conway miss conway
jane's felicity was complete when a few days after she received addressed in lord fitzjocelyn's handwriting an illustrated news with a whole page containing the reception of mrs
how marvellously has he caused his creatures to hold forth this light to attract others to their needful food
others would have risen in alarm but he silenced them by signs and entreaties that no one would frighten her grandmother
he knew that others might have been deceived by the tardiness and uncertainty of his attachment but that it had taken such deep root that he believed he could no more detach himself from mary than if she were his wife
probation maybe safer than joy and you may do more good to yourself and others than even under isabel's wing
i'd not object old dynevor blood my poor oliver you have so learnt to think of money that you can't believe others live for anything else
fortunately oliver had too much on his hands to have much time to spend with the others but when they were together there was scarcely a safe subject not even the intended names of the twins
some censured his old opinions others his new studies one had been affronted by being almost told his boy was a dunce another hated all this new fangled nonsense
her father decidedly triumphed in the mortification that her sex was to others of the family and though he averred that the birth of a son would not have made him change his mind he was well satisfied to be spared the attack which would have ensued
sometimes the woman took offence at her for being high at others she forced on her advice upon her dress or tried to draw out confidences either on lovers or the affairs of the family
isabel cared not at all for farming and took no part in mere country squire's talk and james was too much overburthened with troubles and anxieties to enter warmly into those of others
i fully believed you committed to miss conway
he is at the san benito mine miss ponsonby
miss dynevor was to have a personal attendant and mrs
oh miss clara oh my lord
i dare say miss mary you would like to scold me
i suppose charlotte misses jane said louis
miss blamire what makes you so lame to day
miss conway faltered mary who could never remember her when in louis's presence
miss mary lying down i believe they never told her i was there
he distinctly said he would not take it on himself to recommend miss ponsonby's continuing her journey
rigid as miss ponsonby was she began to be touched
you don't fall quite short of the character of miss dynevor
do you know louis what she was to him showed me what the mother's love must be which we never missed because because we had her
the self justifying tone rather puzzled miss king
with miss conway's own fortune and the terrace settled on herself where could be any risk
even robson cautious as he was said he could not undertake to recommend miss ponsonby to continue her journey
louis and mary missed the security and felicity that seemed so perfect with james and isabel
i am glad you think so properly sir returned miss ponsonby
the gentle authority of his manner had deprived miss ponsonby of all notion of interfering
she clung to mary for support and once said oh miss ponsonby how composed you are
in fact miss ponsonby i must confess that was a most unfortunate blunder of mine last august
it added to clara's regrets that she should miss the harvest supper for which he and mr
the calm lofty manners that had been admired in miss conway were thought pride in mrs
yes miss mercy undertakes her she is doing well she would not hear of my staying
indeed said miss king i am almost surprised that you have been able to finish them at all with so much re writing
i should have said practical life made things real gaid miss king
and miss dynevor and louis was taking pleasure in baffling her with cool quiet answers especially when she came to the question whether miss dynevor had not a brother and why he was not present
ladylike dress high wages work among flowers and gauzes reading to miss louisa housekeeper's room society rank as arnold or miss arnold
another declared that miss conway would not have him at any price and was set upon the poor tutor and that he was lying dangerously ill of a low fever
one day however miss ponsonby called her into her room to tell her that a parcel was going to lima in case she wished to send anything by it
miss ponsonby spoke so kindly and yet so delicately and charlotte blushed and faltered and felt that she must write now
he never missed attending prayers on the sundays and from all i could see i do fully believe that he is a sincerely good religions man and if he keeps on as he has begun i think you are very happy in belonging to him
on arriving they were ushered into the room where miss ponsonby was at breakfast and a cup of tea and untasted roll showed where her niece had been
they parted bravely spectators hindered all display of feeling and no one cried except miss ponsonby
ward with protecting anxious kindness insisted on seeing miss ponsonby safely home before he would join them
on the third rosita was made happy by unpacking an elegant little black papier mache table a present from miss ponsonby
ward was often a welcome addition delighting in anything so english and finding miss ponsonby much improved by her introduction to english society
he hurried clara down the garden and into the carriage and she had her last nod from miss faithfull at the open window
miss mercy was at the station whither school hours had hindered james from accompanying them but where they found lord ormersfield and louis
some pensy chiels a new sprung race wad next their welcome pay but sair on ilka well kenned face i missed the youthful bloom
miss blamire oliver had sent orders to his mother to sleep in london and proceed the next morning by a train which would arrive at about two o'clock
dynevor my niece miss dynevor lord ormersfield lord fitzjocelyn came so repeatedly as quite to jingle in their ears
frost and began to tell her with a tone of patronage how good a neighbourhood it was and how much pleasure she should have in introducing miss dynevor
it was anguish to have come too late and to have missed the last word and look and he strode madly up and down the room almost raving at the separation and removal which he declared had killed her
we are going abroad she said uncle oliver thinks it a part of my education and declares he will not have me behind the miss brittons
daintily did he greet them and stand warming himself before the fire adapting his conversation to them for the next ten minutes before he ventured to ask whether miss arnold were still an inmate
she would not meet his eye and he was too well bred for one word on the stairs but in the garden he exclaimed miss arnold what have i done
and even the sensible miss king observed smiling that there always _would_ be nonsense between men and maidservants and there were many more dangerous places than the present
and charlotte she ought to have been happy with her higher wages and emancipation from the more unpleasant work with the expectation of one whom she admired so enthusiastically as miss conway and above all with the long open hearted affectionate letter which miss ponsonby had put into her hand with so kind a smile
mansell became cautious lest his impulse should have carried him too far and after having ordered the vehicle to be prepared he caught her by the hand and detained her saying mind you miss you are not to take this for over much
even should miss conway not like to keep house with the old woman said she by way of persuading herself she had no such expectation it was her duty to keep the place in repair
she had only gradually become aware of the extent of the mutual aversion between him and the earl and miss ponsonby's reproaches awakened her to the fear that she had too lightly given credence to hostile evidence
she did not see fitzjocelyn again till nearly dinner time and as he caught her anxious interrogating eye he came to her and said very low i was not let in miss ponsonby was engaged
lord ormersfield hastily turned to look at his son's countenance it was flushed and melancholy but fully in earnest nevertheless the earl would not believe his ears and made a sound as if he had missed the words
there was a doubt as to his admission when he came on sunday morning mistress saw no one on sunday but when his name was carried in miss ponsonby could not withstand mary's face
a silence and then miss ponsonby said after all my dear though i thought quite otherwise at first i do believe that considering what the youth is and how much attached he seems you might safely continue the engagement
louis would not be denied seeing mary on board the valdivia and in spite of all miss ponsonby's horror of railways he persuaded her to trust herself under his care to liverpool
ponsonby would be delighted but grieved that no one had met her valdivia not expected so soon not anticipated the pleasure if they had imagined that miss ponsonby was a passenger my father desired that i would come out by her said mary
they get you there flatter you up with their attentions but when they find you too wise for them the first time off goes this youth to miss conway finds her a bad speculation no heiress at all and disposes of her to his cousin
my boy she saw knew heard nothing save that the son missed and mourned for thirty four years was safe within her arms the longing void filled up
a strong impulse drew him to bryanston square where miss ponsonby was very kind and warm the more so because she had discovered how much easier it had been to say than to unsay and strongly regretted the injustice she had done him
mine was marked private too said charlotte slowly as she fixed her eyes on the envelope marianne held out to her and putting her hand into her pocket pulled out a similar one directed to miss arnold
then came a scented shining note requesting to be informed whether the right construction had been put on some words that had dropped from the miss conways and if it were true that the reverend and respected mr
lastly there descended on clara's devoted head a cheque for a sum which terrified her imagination and orders to equip herself suitably as miss dynevor of cheveleigh who was to enjoy the same allowance half yearly
failing the presence of one so dear he rejoiced however to be able to introduce to them his only daughter and he begged that his friends would drink the health of the heiress of cheveleigh miss dynevor
i hear he played fast and loose till he found your daughter had better prospects than miss conway whom my fool of a nephew chose to marry and now he is making up to my niece
the good miss faithfulls struggled in vain to silence scandal and keep it from coming round and luckily isabel was the last person likely either to hear or resent
said isabel smiling it seems that she trusted to making a grand appearance with the remains of yesterday's pudding and that she was quite overset by the discovery that ellen and miss catharine had been marauding on them
he arranged therefore that he should follow her in a fortnight's time the miss faithfulls undertaking the charge of their small namesakes and lady conway wrote to fix a day when delaford should come to take care of isabel on her journey
she tied on a clean apron and running upstairs opened the drawing room door and said if you please ma'am might i ask miss faithfull's martha to tea on tuesday night
the last kisses were given to the children and a message left with charlotte for her master who was in school then she stood with miss catharine in her arms and saw the fly drive off
miss ponsonby was convinced that the news had been exaggerated and insisted that but for lord ormersfield's dislike it would have been further sifted and she wrote to mary to urge her coming to her to await the full tidings instead of delaying among her father's avowed enemies
frost to remain with her until her grandchildren should be with her and miss ponsonby's correspondence ceased after a dry though still kind letter which did not make mary more willing to bestow her confidence but left her feeling in her honest heart as if she were dealing insincerely by aunt melicent
mary's taste counsel and needle did good service her hearty interest and consideration were given to the often turned volume of designs for bedsteads sofas and window curtains and miss mercy herself had hardly so many resources for making old furniture new
as he spoke there was a tap at the door and miss ponsonby stiffly entering said excuse my interruption but i hope lord fitzjocelyn will be considerate enough not to harass you any longer with solicitations to act against your conscience
lord ormersfield came forward to learn whether he might see mary and was met by assurances that she must be kept as quiet as possible upon which he took leave making a stately bend of the head while louis shook miss ponsonby's hand and said he should come to the door to inquire before the day was over
miss ponsonby was one of the many good women given to hard judgments on slight grounds and to sudden reactions still more violent and the sight of lord fitzjocelyn spending a quiet respectable sunday had such an effect on her that she transgressed her own mandate and broached the distressing subject
if mrs willis always averred that she never could have gone through the voyage without miss ponsonby mary felt in return that the little fretful boy and girl who would never let her sit and think except when both were asleep had been no small blessing to her

i know his manner seeming to assent and never committing himself and i ought to have gone through anything rather than have taken such an accusation for granted
what a state you are in
that last onset of accomplishments is serious
how could you come away if he would still have you
oh won't you mary would have been a wonderful person had she not instantly and utterly forgotten all her conclusions from frampton's having declared him gone to beauchastel for an unlimited time but all she did was to turn away her crimson tearful face and reply your father would not wish it now

stories appeared to vary
he will be after us directly with a piteous story
i almost believe that some day i shall wake up and find myself an accomplished young lady
mansell and wants to tell her story by letter
the hermit had transported him into his hut and comforted adeline and was beginning a consolatory harangue making revelations that were to set everything right when just as he had gone as far as my son know that i did not always wear this amice there was a tap at the door and she saw fitzjocelyn who had been at oakstead for the last few weeks attending to some matters connected with his constituency
especially when in a rabid state
oliver designed a stately funeral
always thinking for me

it was all the fault of your clerk robson said james he would not refute the story
ponsonby and telling exultingly some stories of the favourite clerk's sharp practice
you have been always most kind to me but you cannot really like this

oh that he should imagine me caring for this horrid horrid state and grandeur

nevertheless the nurse was always complaining the children though healthy always crying and their father always certain it was somebody's fault
may god take away the sin from us both
no no let me get away from this place
but unluckily i can't persuade your uncle not to think the real story all my partiality and you might do much more if it be not too unpleasant to you
what says isabel she held up her stately head and thought it would be a better return for mr
mary had seated herself in the solid stately chair with the whole entrenchment of tea equipage before her
i don't know it would have caused her anxiety and distress when she was in no state for them
still isabel in her superior prudence resolved to consult fanshawe on the true state of affairs
lord ormersfield was surprised into an emphatic interjection and inquiry whether they were all gone mad
she was np early in hopes of seeing her father before he went to his office but he was gone for a ride
i know the old place at lima and the place knows me and what do i care for this now my mother is gone

actuated by all these motives he declined the offer of hospitality and rowed across to bickleypool enlightening the captain on the state of affairs as far as he desired
ward sat by mary and spoke to her kindly not openly referring to the state of her home but showing a warmth and consideration which evinced much delicate sympathy
you do not understand the true state of the case papa and without doing so you cannot write such an answer aa they deserve
by and by when the parlour tea could by no possibility be supposed to be farther prolonged there swept into the kitchen the stately nurse
i always knew what ponsonby was and nothing from him coldd surprise me even such an outrage on feeling and decency
i remember now that dear mamma always said she did not know whether he would consent
i always knew that women were fools whenever a title came in their way i see it more than ever now since you and melicent are both like the rest of em
jane petted her now still more than charlotte and was always promising her the delightful air and the luxuries of cheveleigh
i always was thankful i never could write to be deluded with nonsense by the post and i am more so than ever now
they understand each other they have always been like brother and sister and i cannot have the children teased or things put into their heads
she knows us but she is almost always drowsy and very hard to rouse
in fact father i have always thought it most wonderfully kind forbearance that you never reproached me more for my doings on that occasion
he always has her downstairs when he is at home and he has accustomed her to so much attention that there is no doing anything while she is by or i would have her more with me
the boy had orders not to wait and these being seconded by fears of something that walked in ebbscreek wood after dark he was gone before an answer could be thought of
when both were gone she drew a long breath and nodded with her head whispering to herself in a grave and critical voice that is love
he has gone and broken poor marianne's heart and now he wants to treat me the same and make me faithless to poor tom that is up in the mountain tops and trusts to me
so she went away and stayed a weary while but when she came it was worth the waiting
i'm afraid it is a silly business and i did not want you to throw yourself away on a schoolmaster
isabel ran away to excuse and explain her confession to lady conway while mr
there was only one bride as he told louis whom he could ever wish to give away
if any one had told me when i tore myself away from cheveleigh that i should have it back how little i should have thought that i could take it so easily
he would she began to answer but the rest died away only answered by tom with an emphatic he _would_
ward and they went on so long in silence that mary hoped it was over and yet he did not go away from her
i must apologize for having thrust myself on you sir said louis but indeed i could not stay away
the pleasure with which he received mary's letters was the single satisfaction that she carried away with her
away skipped charlotte and in two minutes was at the back door of the house beautiful
mary blushed but her tender heart was chiefly caring to know how much he had been hurt and so the whole story was unfolded by due questioning and the earl had full and secret enjoyment of the signal defeat of his dear sister in law the one satisfaction on which every one seemed agreed
but louis wanted her seal of approval to all his past doings and soon began on their inner and deeper story ending with tell me whether you think i was right my own dear governess oh no you must never call me that any more
yes said louis to the astonished aunt since i have heard the true state of the case i have been convinced that there is no choice for her but to go out to repair the injustice so unfortunately done to this poor lady
clara ran up to her uncle laid her hand on his arm and drew him into a window whence he presently turned saying your sister tells me that you cannot be so long absent in the present state of your family
it had stereotype leg rhenium won she had day
the delay had been an advantage for he was less irritated and she had regained self possession
nay mary you won good everywhere
cried louis she was keeping it from me not to spoil the day
good bye my dear she said i know the day will come when all this will be made up
she has been unwell all day and i have scarcely persuaded her to go to sleep
he was in a proper rage at your letter but it would have blown over if you had stuck by her and he is worth enough to set you all on your legs
ah she said she could not bear that you should be pained on your friend's wedding day
i beg her pardon but i can't construct a whole child from an inch of mottled leg as professor owen would a megalosaurus from a tooth
she will break down some day said james if not before certainly when she hears that madison has a peruvian wife
oh thought clara as she went up that night why will the days one most expects to be happy turn out so much otherwise
he blushed a little as he spoke and mary ventured to reply to what she gathered of his thought no other day would suit you as well
she carried his request to her father and was answered that of course he might take a holiday if he could leave the works with safety he had better spend a few days in the town when he did come
she said meekly one day that it might be her penalty to see them at variance in her own lifetime but over her grave perhaps they would be reconciled and her prayers be answered
isabel little guessed that in the days when she viewed the fantastic viscount as her greatest enemy the announcement of his approach would have been far less appalling to her
willis counted the days till she could arrive and meet her husband poor mary felt as if but for these two chances of comfort she could gladly have prolonged the voyage for the rest of her life
another day was nearly the same only that this time she had to do her best to explain the newest fashions in behalf of a dress of rosita's then being made and in the evening to go to a party at the consul's where she met mr
on a fast day or any other occasion that kept her at home she either arranged her jewels discussed her dresses or had some lively chatter which she called learning english
the last day came
having seen her safe under jane's fondling care and infectious exultation he betook himself to the drawing room relieved his aunt's anxiety by a whisper and won golden opinions from the whole company before they were fairly got rid of and oliver begged to conduct his mother to her apartment
the departure of the next english mail should be the limit of her endurance and after a day of watching she finally went up to her father when he would have bidden her good night and said in english papa if you please i must speak to you
the kindness of her welcome gave her a little hope and she went over and over again her own part of the discussion which she expected almost persuading herself that louis's own conduct and her aunt's testimony must win the day
she should hear all when clara came home the next day and should be ready for the happy pair when they would return for christmas after a brief stay at thornton conway which isabel wished james to see that he might share in all her old associations
clara was going patiently and quietly through those trying days with womanly considerateness believing herself supported by her brother and being so in fact by the mere sisterly gratification of his presence though she was far more really sustained and assisted by fitzjocelyn
however he had forgotten all by the time he came upstairs and began to deliver a message from lady conway that she was going to write in a day or two to beg for a visit from isabel during her sojourn at estminster a watering place about thirty miles distant
meanwhile isabel had found it much harder to part with her babies for three weeks than it had seemed at the first proposal and there were tears in her eyes as she gazed at the peaked red tiled roof of the old grammar school and reckoned the days and hours before her husband would join her
it is a name belonging to my happiest days
the day was spent in business
it was a day of rest and they valued it accordingly
if ever i thought to see the day
danvers with her every day
dr hastings came to day and oh
if possible the day shall be hastened
she had hopes of the period allotted to the siesta to which custom in old days she had never acceded but had always spent the interval on any special occupation above all to writing for him but he went off without any notice of her and she was in no condition to dispense with the repose for her frame was tired out though her hopes and fears could not even let her dreams rest
sir andrew was not a lady's man and after he had heard how far miss dynevor had come to day that she had never ridden and had not seen the menai tubular bridge he discontinued the difficult task and she finding that he had not even seen the cathedral which she had passed only fifteen miles off gave him up and occupied herself with watching the infinite variety of affectations which mrs
you were the first to tell me she said as she bade louis good night with fondness additional to her messenger of good news but as he pressed her dear old trembling hand his heart misgave him whether her joy might not be turned to pain and when he congratulated jane and heard her call it a blessed day he longed to be certain that it would prove so
goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life
those were not happy days with the little maiden
the remaining part of the day passed quietly
the following day was sunday and nothing worse took place than little skirmishes in which the uncle and nephew's retort and rejoinder were so drolly similar that clara found herself thinking of miss faithfull's two sandy cats over a mouse but she kept her simile to herself finding that isabel regarded the faintest gentlest comparison of the two gentlemen almost as an affront
i could not spoil their wedding day that we had wished for so long
young men are taught to think more seriously than they were in our day said mrs
her transport was one of the few pleasant things of that day
he forgot the difference between the pastime of an hour and the employment of a day
some day i shall throw a bucket of cold water over her
all the rest is an obstinate and dismal allegiance to the days of shrievalty about as easy to recall as the days when the pendragons wore golden collars and armlets
she has that is like her
i think i am not quite myself to day i will go to my room
i was determined to say it to day that the worst might be over but i can't argue nor bear your kindness now
he was desirous of seeing you mary but i have been telling him i could permit no more interviews to day
oh no said mary putting her hand to her head as if it could bear no more not to day
we will settle it between us and have it right yet but we must give her to day to think it over and get over the first shock
that was the sort of conversation into which they fell now and then during those last days of busy sadness
tresham used in my day no one thought the worse of him unlucky your taking orders
the first day of adventure they slept at a hacienda surrounded with fields where numerous llamas were pasturing
oliver's clear harsh tones incapable of slowness or solemnity began to return thanks for himself and pronounce this to be the happy day to which he had been looking throughout his life the day of restoring the family inheritance to his mother and the child of his elder brother he faltered he never could calmly speak of henry
we will meet when i claim you in the face of day without the sense of stolen felicity which is a charm to common place minds
he opposed it he wanted to bring in a very ordinary style of person from school but jem's superiority and the general esteem for my aunt carried the day
all the rest of the party journeyed to london on a november day and in gaslight and gloom they deposited mary at her aunt's house in bryanston square
the whole party were to dine with lady conway and trusting in the meantime to discover what was on her spirits be tried to resign himself to the order of the day without a farther glimpse of her
the voice which i did more esteem than music in her sweetest key those eyes which unto me did seem more comfortable than the day those now by me as they have been shall never more be heard or seen
a growing day as the country people term such genial gentle weather might not be without analogy to the brief betrothal of louis and mary
and the furrow of fire left by their vessel's wake spoke to her of that path like a shining light shining more and more unto the perfect day
oliver and his mother were in the sitting room and on james's return from school in the middle of the day he was summoned thither
yet he still believed that patience and perseverance would win the day and tried to derive encouragement and energy from the thought that this might be a trial sent for the very purpose of training him in steadfastness
martha really said charlotte one day i don't think a catastrophe is half so pretty as it ought to be
as i drew near my ancient pile my heart beat a the way the place i passed seemed yet to speak of some dear former day
little george henderson said the grey headed gentleman for once a real gentleman i assure you i have not forgotten the happy days i have spent here
i thought the family had afforded quite spectacles enough for one day said louis and besides i had some pity upon your grandmother and on your uncle too
we have made something of a nest in the last of the suite of rooms the only one habitably small but it is wonderful where all the time in the day goes
once on that day james was visibly startled from his heavy stern mood of compressed indignant sorrow
three weeks longer did the session drag on but on the joyful day when release was given lord ormersfield was surprised to find mr
and there he sits at the head of that long melancholy table trying to bring back days that have gone too far ever to be recalled and only raising their spectres in this mocking finery scarcely one man present whose welcome comes from his heart his mother past the days of heeding the display except for his sake his nephew rejecting him you indignant and miserable
she said she had come to perceive that she had confounded pride with independence
lord ormersfield had not the heart to see one error in his son on such a day as this more especially as mary peeped out behind the urn to judge of his countenance and he met her pleading eyes swimming in tears
greatly touched by her consideration for him on the wedding day he would not torture her with pleadings and was only too grateful for every service that he was allowed to render her without protest as still her chief and most natural dependence
he facilitated much that would have been arduous for two solitary women and did little all day but go about for mary fulfilling the commissions which her father had sent home and though he did it with a sore heart it was still a privilege to be at work for mary
he led her into a magnificent apartment all gilding blue brocade and mirrors as far as might be after the model of the days of the shrievalty but the bare splendour could ill recall the grace and elegance that had then reigned there without effort
clear sharp and cold was the air next day the snow fields glistened gloriously in the rising sun and a rose coloured mist seemed to rise from them
not till the middle of the day did they meet the line of mules and not until the sunset did they find themselves close before the wonderful perforated san benito summit
tom explained that all the miners would be making holiday and the senior cornishman might safely be left in charge of the works while he only wished to spend christmas day itself in the city and would be a very short time absent
how does she look
has she had my letter
she will honour you
is she not here
she has her oliver
i had many penances to do for quitting my convent padre inigo was very severe but they are over at last and i am free for giving alms twice a week and the sisters have forgiven me and send me so many silver flowers and dulces i will show them to you some day
see here charlotte said marianne one afternoon when they sat down together to their sewing marianne's eyes were brighter and her cheeks pinker than for many days see here it is for your good i show it you that you mayn't build on no false expectations
he now wished to inspect matters himself in order to answer the numerous questions sent by oliver and rosita eagerly catching at any proposal which promised a variety a party was made up for ascending to the san benito mines some days journey from lima
and when darkness came on too early for english associations with warm days the lights of the village at the mine glittered merrily and apparently close at hand and the stars above shone as mary had never seen them so marvellously large and bright and the magellan clouds so white and mysterious
the paths above were fit for none save a chamois or a barefooted indian or a sailor for the midshipman was climbing aloft in such places that tom's chief work was to summon him back in horror lest he should involve himself in endless galleries excavated before the days of atahualpa
mr calcott agreed with him that nothing could be more desirable but doubted whether the parents would compel their sons to attend and advised james to count the cost doubting whether in the long run he would be able to dispense with one day of entire rest
homage to her days of gallant exertion in poverty was most welcome and touching to the young people but their uncle without taste to understand it wishing to forget her labours and fancying them discreditable to a daughter of the dynevors received the proposal like an indignity and but for fitzjocelyn's mediation and expostulations it would have been most unsuitably rejected
she exclaimed obeying however because though she could run she could not stand
it she did not intend it gave cork but s he has tied her were all she
if she is not she won't and lord ormersfield has no business to tease her
she gave us very little trouble
she gave up the hope of seeing it said clara but she looked to it all the same
he freely gave her leave to go wherever she pleased and said not a word against northwold
she released him entirely from his engagement entreating him not to rebel against the decision but to join her in thankfulness that no shade need be cast over the remembrance of the happy hours spent together and begging him not to grieve since she had after the first pain been able to acquiesce in the belief that the separation might conduce to his happiness and she should always regard him as one of those most near and dear to her and rejoice in whatever was for his welfare glad that his heart was still young enough to form new ties
i gave your letter conjuring her to let isabel have it and though she declared that it was no kindness and would put the poor darling into needless perplexity she was touched with my forbearance in not having given it before when i had such an opportunity
she gave a little start and scream and stood up to let him pass
i gave notice to isabel that i am come to dinner and no doubt she had rather i were disposed of
i will try repeated mary and then she added these grand hill tops and blue sky almost make a church yes ma'am said tom his black eyes lighting at the thought i've felt so sometimes but tis a mighty lonely one after a time
he tried to believe this caution but he thought she was also eluding bis father and her whole air gave him a vague uneasiness
his affection for mary gave her no more pain than did that of james for isabel and she would have treated with scorn and anger anything that impeached his constancy
she is very kind it is not that
she would never think of him again and she was sure he would not think of her
up went her queenly head as she believed her powers were meant for other things but her heart gave a painful throb at the recollection that poverty had been her voluntary choice and had seemed perfect felicity with james
isabel gave herself credit for the most notable arrangement she had ever made promoting the little maiden whom she really liked and relieving herself from the constant annoyance about sparing ellen from the nursery by obtaining a stronger housemaid
besides she had not time to be unhappy
is it not humiliating she said to be so altered by finery
she would not have me put jem out of his birthright
and she was not teased nor harassed
i suppose she might be if you were not absorbed in that writing
it would not have come to a crisis by this time if she had not taken me to paris
it would not be right she said his father would not allow it
she did not scruple to allow him to assist her she understood the gratification to him and it was only too sweet to her to be still his object
she added resolved to show him that she would not discuss these matters with him i have a parcel for him
f dynevor from being hurt or disappointed and indeed i scarcely think he will though i should not avail myself of the permission for meeting him so kindly intended
she sighed he could not tell you so clara for it is not wrong and he knows it is not
they were better than could have been hoped they gave us their votes when they found their man could not get in
if i gave my voice against it i should fear to bring on us a curse and not a blessing
where there was true affection and sound trust she could not would not and did not fear for those she loved
she asked him the names of the various mountain peaks in sight whose bare crags too steep to support the snow here and there stood out dark in salient contrast to the white scenery and as he gave them to her mentioning the few facts that he had been able to gather respecting them she was able to ask him whether he was in the habit of seeing anything approaching to society
i knew it would never do she added though i could not say so before her and fitzjocelyn
not an hour but i have felt it and now father what does she mean
she need not have spent so many hours in preparation for the morning
whether this end well or not she is the leading star of my life
she continued i could not be disappointed he answered shortly
mary would have had more reason to have turned about if she had not found him married
she believed it had not agreed with her to sit up late
she drew her breath in sobs but could not speak
tapada she cried you surely are not going out tapada
she was very pale and her eyes looked as if she had cried all night but she controlled her voice to say i could not bear that you should hear it from aunt melicent
you know she is all elasticity and things are pleasanter here to her than to me but i do not think she enjoys life as she did at home
she assured mrs james frost that she did not think delaford to blame many girls would be foolish about a man with personal advantages but she could not see it was his fault
she saw not that the stripling had become a worn and elderly man she recked not how he came
not here not now clara said louis she is in perfect peace unhurt by our unhappy dissensions she is with him who looks at hearts who can take away all variance
she had been willing to live on a small scale but she did not understand personal superintendence she was careless of display and perfectly happy as long as she was the guest of the grandmother but she had no comprehension of petty tidinesses or small economies
i think not she was grieved if i were set against uncle oliver's plans and really hurt if she could not make him think as she did about right and wrong but otherwise she was always bright
she did not think the world contained louis's equal but she had always known that his love was disposed of and she no more thought of wishing for it than for any other impossible thing
beckett was gone and she had no protector and martha relented told her that if she had minded her she would never have been in the scrape at all but agreed not without satisfaction to afford mr
of this she would not hear and she was exceedingly grateful to louis for abstaining from pressing her as well as for writing to mr
she smiled dreamily and repeated beautiful as though all were so beautiful already to her that she did not so much as perceive the fog
louis began to imagine a determination to exclude him and was eagerly beginning to say that she had asked him to come that morning could she not see him
marianne did not divulge the tender and melancholy letter of reproach that she posted privately but she grew paler and coughed more all that bright summer
she says isabel's soft tones made a paradise for her but late hours which she did not feel at the time wore her out and delaford trifled with her
she looks ill no wonder said james she is not strong enough for such work
knowing isabel as the governess did she was sure that she would not merely talk of things on the surface if her spirit were fully content
dull boys or such as had a half sullen half conservative dislike to change did not gain notice of an agreeable kind and while intending to show strict justice he did not know how far he was affected by his prepossessions
cried louis for all greeting why can she say you would not wish it now
where is she it does not amount to a scruple in her case deliberately resumed the earl
martha declared that she was just as bad as an old dumbledore and not worth half so much
had not her fondness and her desolation prevailed where for louis's own sake she should have held back
and this spanish woman who if she does not deserve all that has been said of her no doubt soon will
she might carry it too far but the principle was sound and a father could not well controvert it
mr ward did not think that she was expected by the valdivia mr
she unveiled her eyes to natural history and did not find flower or butterfly unsoothing
she was on kind and friendly terms with rosita but they did not become more intimate than at first
asked isabel not unless i go early and beg for her and then she generally has some master
well for her that she did not hear robson say that young man knows how to come over the ladies
poor jane when her task of nursing is over i do not know what she will turn to
he was not alarmed at first but yesterday she was inert and sleepy and he asked for more advice
jem he calls it a breaking up of the constitution and does not think she will rally
she blamed herself so that i could not bear to hear it for the grand fine things in her life
she often said he must not be left with no one to make a home for him and to go out to lima again
she did not see the difference between doing her best when her will was thwarted and her present life of neglect and indulgence
my uncle wished grandmamma to manage the house and she did so at first but she and the servants did not get on well together and she said what i never knew her say before that she is too old and so we have an awful dame who rules with a high hand
she never let him know all her straits and was too proud she said to ask when she was hurt at his not offering help and so she made him seem more hard hearted and let us become set against him
and jane oh she goes said clara recovering a smile she is firmly persuaded that we shall run into another revolution and as she could not frighten us by the description of your wounds she decides to come and dress ours when we get any
lord ormersfield gave a quick searching glance as he said james frost did not make use of our interest in this matter
mary had made up her mind that they should not have been taken thither if there were any real danger and so though she could have preferred her mule taking the inner side of the ledge and was not too happy when it climbed like a cat she smiled and answered all inquiries that she did not think she ought to be frightened
james intending to marry on the grammar school
it was not easy to understand him he would not talk of home was brief about his little catharine and when clara said something of isabel's writings formerly his great pride and feared that she would have no more time for them his blunt answer was she ought not
a wedding was not the scene which poor mary wished to witness at present but she saw louis bent on having her with him and would not vex him by reluctance
she received them with stiff upright chillness and to their hope that mary was not unwell replied not very well
he had the eye for neatness that she wanted he could not believe it a hardship to go without indulgences to which his grandmother and sister had not been accustomed
charlotte did not know whether she was glad that the cook could not tease her about delaford or mortified to be supposed beneath his notice
she had never had much hope though now she found it had been more than she had been willing to believe and even now she could not absolutely cease to entertain some hopes of the results of oliver's return nor silence one lingering fancy that louis might yet wait unbound although she told herself of his vacillation between herself and isabel of his father's influence and of the certainty that he would see many more worthy of his love than herself
rosita who now it came to the point was not without fears of sleeping on the bare mountain side wanted to push on she was sure they could arrive before night but she was told that she knew nothing of mountain atmosphere and she was not discontented with the bright fire and comfortable arrangements on which they suddenly came after turning round a great shoulder of rock
her wanted she was sneezed because them had sneezed they do they seem her had worn it was most for him made she do not miss head stroke
nay said louis after hearing her father's letter i do not see that it is possible for her to do otherwise
i found i was not wanted added mary with a degree of agitation that made him conclude that she had lost her father
she was sorry to see the grieved dejected expression on his good sensible though somewhat worn countenance and she esteemed him highly but who could have thought of so unlucky a fancy coming into his head
this was the most trying stroke of all for it set her in the eyes of the cook and nurse on a level with the inferior servants to whom he would not have deigned a look and it was not easy to resist showing that she was on more familiar terms with him than all
she shook her head
ah she shook her head
three or four stout hearty cornish miners with picks on their shoulders made the contrast stranger and among them stood a young man whose ruddy open face carried mary home to ormersfield in one moment and she could not but blush almost as if it had been louis when she bent her head in acknowledgment of his bow
mr ward had exactly the excellent well balanced character which seemed made to suit her and she could have imagined being very happy with him if no no mr
the worst was over when she had inflicted the stroke on louis and seen him ready to support instead of adding to her distress
i heard the weeding women saying she had not one bit of pride and when i told her of it she shook her head and laughed sadly and said that was the kind of thing which had taken her in
so she made a cloister of this grand house
dear jemmy said she taking his arm as they went home in the evening did not that psalm seem meant for us
she roused herself and sat upright speaking resolutely but not daring to look at him i made up my mind last night
she could trust him not to presume his approval made her almost happy and yet it was hard that his very patience and acquiescence should endear him so much as to render the parting so much the more painful
she was certain that some discovery had been made and longed to explain but she was wise enough not to speak in haste and waited to see how the old gentleman would finally break it to her
james had effectually destroyed all pleasure on her part and had made the change appear an unmitigated misfortune even though she did not know what she would have thought the worst
she said isabel was old enough to know her own mind and the attachment being so strong and you so unexceptionable she did not think it possible to object she had great delight in seeing you made happy and fulfilling the dictates of her own heart now that it could be done with moderate prudence
this was too much for mary and when her father would have kissed her she laid her head on his shoulder and wept silently but bitterly
it was very dreary and she would have given the world to be alone with her throbbing head her dull heartache and the weariness of spirits over long wound up for the meeting but her own apartment could be no refuge until it had been cleansed and made ready and dolores and xavier were persecuting her every moment with their hospitality and their inquiries
holdsworth on necessary affairs connected with his farm and improvements mentioning facts instead of feelings and promising to write to aunt catharine when he should have time but the time did not seem to come and it was easy to believe that his passiveness of will increased by the recent stroke had caused him to be hurried into a condition of involuntary practical activity
of clara no account was vouchsafed except that isabel believed she was abroad they had been very much disappointed in her and isabel was afraid that she was a good deal altered and the snbject seemed so painful that virginia did not venture to push her inquiries any farther
it appeared that oliver had made almost as if his mother had been buried and dug up again involving the thirty four years of her exile in such utter mystery that people had begun to make all sorts of wild stories to account for her proceedings and lord fitzjocelyn's explanation that she had lived in her own house in northwold and taught him the latin grammar seemed quite a disappointment from the simplicity and want of romance
clara had stood all the time like a statue on the stairs waiting to see if she were wanted and gazing intently with her fingers clasped
smithers who never having been in contact with a live lord wanted to make the most of him and before she had arrived at her place was declaring that it was a most interesting occasion just like a scene at the opera
frost's young mrs golding and on the eager inquiry whether she were present ensued the melancholy answer that she was deaf and infirm only just able to smile with pleasure at the tidings of her old friend's restoration and the daughter whom she could only just believe to be grown up was a worn elderly woman
they said she would sleep the easier for it and she thanked me as if it had really set her more at rest but how sad how strange it seems when she knows that she is sinking fast and has had mr
it was very like being miss conway still and when she awoke the next morning to find it late and to the impulse of hurrying up or _not_ hurrying expecting to find james making breakfast himself and cross at being made late for school she turned on her pillow half doubting whether she had dreamt these two years in one long night and remembering that captive mermaid who had but to resume her maritime headgear and return to her native element to forget the very existence of her fisherman husband and children
poor mary she might speak cheerfully but her despatches were made up with a trembling heart
she said pride had made her stand alone and unkindly spurn much that was kindly meant
the dim light seemed to encourage clara to lift her head to listen to the kind words
with this answer she made him happy and they set off to the extreme joy of rosita who had engrossed much less attention than she had expected and declared she would never have come into these horrible places if she could have imagined what they were like
it was the mistress's eye that was wanting and isabel did not know how to use it
and so she was borne away and her sad heart could not choose but be somewhat enlivened by change and novelty while her uncle made it his business to show her everything as rapidly as it could be seen apparently with no relish himself for aught but perpetual movement
smithers and her scent bottle he was at the back of clara's chair almost before her confused eyes had missed him in her gasps for breath and impulse to do something desperate and so she might if his voice had not been in her ear his hand grasping hers both to console and raise her
somehow it made her do nothing but cry she felt unwilling to sit down and answer it and as if it were out of perverseness when she was in mrs
this brought a kind of laugh but she unfastened the bonnet herself and the first use she made of her breath was fiercely to exclaim how could you
and isabel sighed partly at the memory of the imaginary being for whom she had taken james and partly at the future prospect the narrow sphere the choice between solitude and dull society the homely toils that must increase worn out garments perpetual alphabets children always whining and james always irritated thinking her remiss and coming in with that furrow on his forehead and his hair standing up wildly
now and then she was aware of a sluggish dulness that seemed to be creeping over her higher aspirations a want of glow and feeling on religious subjects even in the most sacred moments and she wondered and grieved at a condition such as she had never experienced in what she had thought far more untoward circumstances
she at least is all she seems whereas i am so infested with civilities that i long to proclaim myself little clara frost bred up for a governess and the laughing stock of her school
it was one of her great comforts that he never seemed in the least vexed at anything she had done since we went home
other associations revived when she found herself at estminster and was received with shrieks of joy caresses and exclamations too fond and foolish to bear repetition and then the pale louisa rested against her stroking her hand and lady conway fondled her and virginia looking formed and handsome retreated a little way to study her and declare that she was the same isabel neither altered nor grown older it was all a dream that she had ever left them
he will have that out of his head
she abstained from raising her eyes to his face from one conscious word or glance she locked herself into her pantry when she took down the breakfast things and avoided every encounter even when she had begun to feel that it would have been more flattering had he made more efforts
she tried to make him promise never to go back but he has only promised never to go while she lives and she seems to think it would be fatal and to charge all his disregard of religious matters upon herself for having sent him out
though warmly invited by the conways and fondly entreated by her grandson she shook her head and said she was past those things and that the old mother always stayed at home to cook the wedding dinner
she took care to tell him her rule but that considering the circumstances she had made an exception in his favour on the understanding that nothing was to break in upon the observance of the sabbath
if you should ever have any thoughts of rescuing her from him my approval would not be wanting and it would be the easiest way of restoring her brother
if he wanted a mere household drudge why had he not looked elsewhere
miss ponsonby was rising with an air of vexed surprise but he never saw her and hastily crossing the room he shut the door behind him and followed the form that flitted up the stairs so fast that he did not come up with her till she had entered the drawing room and stood leaning against a chair to gather breath
i had nearly made her promise that should we find you about to form an establishment of your own she would consider herself as my child but oh father
it was more like a welcome and it brought the willises back shocked at having forgotten her in the selfishness of their own joy but they had made sure that she had been met
sometimes mary wrote for her father and now and then was consulted and she was always grateful for whatever made her feel herself of use
without listening to her cousin's last words she made a gesture to put him aside and rose to hurry to her brother
louis she any district
louis made no answer
louis she said imploringly
she will think it all the better by and by said louis
after two hours spent on the railroad the train entered a district with the bleakness but not the beauty of the neighbourhood of mountains the fresh september breeze was laden with smoke and stations stood thick upon the line
then recovering she added i beg your pardon louis i was treating it as earnest
it was a mistake i know she continued fearing to be unjust and to grieve louis but a most dreadful one
mary you will now was all louis said but she let him draw her into his arms and she rested against his breast as when he had come to comfort her in the great thunderstorm in auld lang syne
her first feeling was that she must tell louis her second that two oceans were between them and then she thought of aunt catharine having lived after all to see her son
dear old jenny i am glad she goes she is the only creature i can talk to but louis before my uncle comes in i have something to give you
ponsonby has desired him to find out all he can about louis and unluckily they have persuaded themselves that poor louis courted isabel supposing that she was to have beauchastel and finding his error betook himself to mary
she laid before him the packet of letters which she had held all this time as the last link to louis and sought his eye as she did so with a look of appeal but he carefully averted his glance and she could read nothing
no no he must tell you she was trying to withdraw her hand when lord ormersfield opened the door and in the moment of his amazed louis
you can hardly stand he would have supported her to the sofa but she shrank from him and leaning more heavily on the chair said do you not know louis all that must be at an end
i do not think she is unkind to mary said louis i could be almost glad that the dear aunt kitty is spared all this worry
that one anticipation of being set at rest by her father's forgiveness and the forlorn despairing hope of his relenting towards louis were all she dared to dwell on and when mrs
the waiting in silence was miserable enough for herself but she would have continued to bear it except for the injustice to louis who must not be kept in suspense
he was indulgent enough even to make no objection to going with her to ormersfield where she wandered about the park visited old scenes with louis and went over all his improvements
it was said with that peculiar cheerfulness with which happy old age can contemplate the end of the pilgrimage and she looked at louis with a sunny smile
louis would have left them to themselves but clara's glance sued for his protection and as he settled himself in his chair she spoke with more decision
louis recurred to the old argument that james did not know what he was saying and recalled her to the remembrance of what she had felt to be the right course before james's ebullition
i will go to him said louis departing out of consideration that she might wish for space to attend to dinner room and dress
mary's heart glowed to her aunt for having been thus conquered by louis she who three nights back had been so severely incredulous so deeply disappointed in her niece for having been deluded into endurance of him
he was gone while she sobbed out her message of love for isabel and louis ran up pale with repressed suffering and speaking with difficulty as he wrung her hand and murmured oh clara
frost's letter which after mentioning with much affection and gratitude all oliver's attempts to make her happy in spite of the many sad changes around ended by saying that poor clara felt the separation from her brother so much that without dear louis she did not know how she would have gone through the festivities
when she could bear it they would dwell together on the precious recollections of her mother and sometimes she could even speak of her father and relate instances of his affection for herself and all his other redeeming traits of character most thankful to louis for accepting him on her word and never uttering one word of him which she could wish unsaid
she was uncomfortable in finding the rule committed to her and all the more because lord ormersfield who had learnt to talk to her so openly that she sometimes thought he confounded her with her mother used in all his schemes to appear to take it for granted that she should share with him in the managing consulting headship of the house leaving louis as something to be cared for and petted like a child without a voice in their decisions
in spite of her past trials of the futility of the attempt to live with a rejected suitor as if nothing had happened she had hopes of the possibility when her own heart was untouched and the gentleman nearly doubled her years but when she talked to her father she gathered that it was considered by both gentlemen that the proposal had been premature and that her final detachment from louis was reckoned on as so certain that mr
you may have it said louis
louis tell him how it is
no louis it must be now or never
i know you had it for me said louis
if i could judge i would said louis
what are you coming to louis
nor i said louis
many of her happiest half hours with louis were spent as she sewed the stiff slippery chintz and he held the curtain rings while aunt catharine went to inspect the workmen and many a time were her cares forgotten and her active spirits resumed while louis acted carpenter under her directions and rectified errors of the workmen
they knew it signified that she was to be unmolested they took their places and the earl carved ham and louis cut bread and mary poured out tea in the most matter of fact manner hazarding nothing beyond such questions as may i give you an egg
lord ormersfield believed clara too much of a child to have any ideas on what was passing and had it depended on him she must have gone home in an agony of ignorance on the cause of her cousin's trouble but louis came with them to the station and contrived to say to her while walking up and down the platform her father is bitter against me
beckett marianne and the french milliner and in such a flounced glace silk such a lace mantle and such a flowery bonnet was she arrayed that lord ormersfield bowed to her as a stranger and louis talked of the transformations of the giraffe
robson seemed anxious to monopolize the attention of the gentlemen to the exclusion of madison and while tom was thus thrust aside mary succeeded in having a conversation with him such as she felt was a sort of duty to louis
he deeply felt the loss of the kind gentle aunt whose sympathy had been more to him than he had known at the time the last remnant of the previous generation the last link with his youth and he was even more grieved for the blank she left with louis than for himself
there was in lady conway much kindness and good humour always ready to find satisfaction in what was inevitable and willing to see all at ease and happy around her a quality which she shared with louis and which rendered her as warm and even caressing to our dear james as if he had been the most welcome suitor in the world and she often sincerely congratulated herself on the acquisition of a sensible gentleman to consult on business and so excellent a brother for walter
louis begged to be the bearer of the letter
louis pressed to hear what
burst out louis in a frenzy
i do not understand you louis
call him louis must i go
frost you would have found us up said louis
not that i am aware of said louis
i am said louis quickly
louis caught up the missive
yours yes but oh louis
stop louis you forget
no louis i know my father
said louis almost overcome
ha said clara that is what louis meant
now it was not only how louis would admire it
louis how glad i am
last from the station said louis
p expression gathering on your brows louis
cried louis oliver is come
said oliver turning on louis
pshaw louis can't you understand
exactly so said louis laughing
said louis chapter vii
louis did not answer
whispered clara to louis
oh louis you want to tear me to pieces
so the safer for humility said louis
i must go and help her said louis
poor child said louis
yes let me go said louis
oh speak to him louis
louis and clara both cried out incredulously
no said clara i wish louis to be here
but louis stood before her and spoke gravely
lucky girl said louis
it will grow said louis smiling
it is very kind in you clara said louis fervently
louis you will never know how to deal with those people
the earl was touched by the dreary desponding tone of the reply and reported it to louis and clara with such terms that clara's decision was made at once namely that it would be wrong and cruel to cast away her uncle and be swayed by james's prejudice and lord ormersfield told her with grave approval that she was quite right and that he hoped that james would recover from his unreasonable folly
as she was asleep he might venture and it was comical to hear him declaring that no one need mistake them for each other and to see him trying to lay them side by side on his knees to be compared when they would roll over and interlace their little scratching fingers and louis stood by teasing him and making him defend their beauty in terms that became extravagant
there's for you louis you are the best fellow living
oh father cried louis indignantly
frost and louis beheld something of forgiveness
cried louis as though reproaching himself for the delay
had broken she had fastened her had sneezed she had leaked they did she know she suppose she seems miss it is not envy they made i but i had not have broken for her being drawn she
her horror would have known no bounds and she would perhaps have broken with her brother forever
she managed to spend every evening in amusement either at the opera or at evening parties where her splendid eyes and scraps of broken english made great havoc among young lieutenants and midshipmen visiting lima
ponsonby but where he went mary went and when he stopped she though she had not drawn since the master at her school had resigned her as a hopeless case applied herself to the perpetration of an outline of the rocks that as she said her aunts might see what sort of place it was
clara smiled i suppose i must bear it she said
does she know i am here
she murmured you know i never thought of that
i will let him know she said with her hand on the bell
she would not know if the furniture weren't rubbed once in ten years but you must make it a pride to yourself to be faithful
it is curious to see how well she knows the difference between us and the nurses
even supposing justice done to poor james she will have a handsome portion
if i could only see clara safe settled here then i should care as little what became of me as i suppose she would
in fact miss ponsonby found the young lord so good and inoffensive that she broke her morning's resolution invited him to partake of the cold dinner let him go to church with them again in the evening and remain to tea and when he took leave she expressed such surprised admiration at his having come and gone on his own feet his church going and his conduct generally that mary could not help suspecting that her good aunt had supposed that he had never heard of the fourth commandment
she had flung herself crouching in a heap on the floor never stirring so that he almost feared she had fainted and kneeling on one knee beside her spoke soothingly my poor little dear clary this is the worst of all but you know it was not jem who spoke
very likely said isabel indifferently and she escaped beckoning with her clara who was rather entertained with the reminiscences over which granny and uncle oliver seemed ready to linger for ever and yet she was rather ashamed of her own amusement and interest when she heard her sister in law say if he did but know how weary i am of that hateful thing a great house
she help them did not counterbalance'dolly i were laid district
i did not think you so weak
then you will not help me
tell me she could not help giving herself the relief when that most loving sympathizing face was pleading with her to let him comfort her
she cannot help it and makes the best of it
mary could not help suspecting that this was because the request had not been preferred through himself
james laid down his pen and stood upright as if he did not understand her words
next to mrs frost's unalloyed gladness the most pleasant spectacle was old jane who volunteered her services in helping to wait that she might have the delight of hovering about master oliver to whom she attended exclusively and would not let charlotte so much as offer him the potatoes
frost herself james afraid that a scene would hurt his wife severely forbade clara to give way and the poor girl mute and white did as she was told and ventured not a word of farewell though her embraces were convulsive and when she went down stairs she could not help kissing charlotte
frost's peace outwardly she was cheerful and helpful equable though less lively
it was my presumptuous inveterate folly that prevented you from trusting my affection when she might have helped us
at least he trusted that her last hours might be crowned by the peacemaker's joy and that she might see strife and bitterness laid aside between oliver and henry's only surviving son
frost the tutor was so mad with jealousy and rage that my lady declared those moorings would not suit her no longer but had let go and laid her head right for beauchastel
he is not persuading me said mary turning towards her aunt a face which through all her dejection proved her peace in his support and approval he is helping me
dynevor came in and seemed pleased to find louis there even asking him whether he could not join them on their tour and help clara to speak french
it was pretty to see his tenderness as he detached the little girl from her hold and laid her in the cot making a little murmuring sound and boasted how she would have shown off if awake and laughed over her droll little jealousies of his even touching the twins
robson it was very unfortunate but it cannot be helped
i am very sorry for her said james but it can't be helped
heaven help her poor lonely child
all this he well understood and reverent to her feeling he laid aside all trifling and waited on her mood with the tenderest watchfulness
he has laid hold of louis who would swallow the whole spanish legion of impostors
louis came forward from the window where he had been standing as in a dream he laid his hand on james's shoulder and said i will go
i don't think any one could help taking the same view said louis
he started towards her as if to help her off her mule but mr
when i have walked five miles in your service you won't afford me an arm to help me back
nay the table was really laid for breakfast a female figure was actually standing over the tea chest
no other course was left open to me and my profession cannot be taken up nor laid down as a matter of convenience
mr ponsonby took care that the paragraph should be laid in his daughter's way and he offered her the sight of oliver dynevor's own letter
his aunt would certainly keep terms with him and he could insure that the case was properly laid before isabel and as there could be no doubt at present of his persuasive powers james caught at the offer
good than he is regretful year there were never fine or apple you am great as her taught she was not try near do anything that her
poor man it was a great pity he did not come last year
oh louis i am glad you would not let me say anything about leaving him
i am more sure of that than of anything else
louis spoke of his regret that scenes of uncongenial gaiety should have been forced upon her last year
you might take the curacy and do a great deal of good
i think i may tell you how she felt it said clara i am trying to tell james but i don't know whether i can
i never wish so much that lord fitzjocelyn should see anything as that said tom madison when mary in her gratitude was trying to say something adequate to the trouble she had given though the beauty was beyond any word of admiration
it is a great disappointment that she is unattainable but i am glad she writes so sensibly and sees that it is right you should think no more about her
that clara took after her father in anything but being tall and fair would hardly have been granted by any one who knew her better than the earl but he readily allowed it and oliver proceeded as long as she does not marry here i am but i trust some one will soon take the care of her off my hands man who would look after the property well
that is what i try to look forward to no i don't think i look forward to anything
a wider range had been given to her thoughts there was a swelling of heart a vividness of sensation such as she had not known in earlier times she had been taught the mystery of creation the strange connexion with the unseen and even with her fellow men
you were little george with the apple cheeks
you must be left free not bound for years and years
if you are not the rose at least you have lived near the rose said louis
good night aunt melicent i am so glad you like him
am i to allow you to be encumbered all the time she is on the other side of the world waiting ponsonby's pleasure to come home at last in ten or fifteen years time worried and fretted to death like her poor mother
i would not for worlds see her led to do anything underhand
no i'm fixed here i must look after henry's child fine girl good tempered girl takes after henry don't you think so
be yourself and be more than yourself and only think of the past as a time when we had a great deal of pleasantness and you did me much good
frost i told you that you must not try to make him turn squire
isabel seldom roused herself to understand anything about her servants but she liked marianne and was glad clara should have her since she was not strong enough to undertake nursery cares
if you had not been mary i might have made you a great goose
she has a famous heap of manuscripts in her desk and one long story about a sir roland who had his name before she knew jem but it is all unfinished she tore out a great many pages and has to make a new finish and i am afraid the poor knight is going to die of a mortal wound at his lady's feet
i am afraid not
peru had not taught oliver taste either of the eye or of the mind and his indefatigable introductions my mother mrs
but i could wish i had not precipitated matters last year
her first idea was what delightful presents could be made to every one but as she was devising showers of gifts for her niece james cut her short i am sorry to give you pain clara but it must be understood that neither directly nor indirectly can i nor mine receive anything bought with my uncle's money
she desired him to make no answer but to consider this as the final dissolution and she concluded by all that she thought would prove most consoling as to the present state of affairs with her and with a few affectionate words to show that he was still a great deal to her though everything he might not be
she was quite aware that the friendship between him and clara might deceive an uninitiated spectator and though she commanded herself to think that an attachment between them would be equally natural and desirable she could not but look with great satisfaction at the easy unsuspicious tone of mrs
oh hush louis this is not good
i was starting off to fetch you when i found she was in great terror
in great distress she exclaimed oh mr
i'd take my affidavit that if the crowner could sit upon her when she dies and die she will that there fine gentleman and his guitar will be found at the bottom of her chest
no i am not ill indeed i am not but i cannot stay
then he was really sorry mamma was so ill and and for all that was past i am sure he felt it was the last parting and only wished to do anything that could make up to her
yours i am not talking of yours
but oh she said almost sobbing where am i
i'd not say i would have believed it the more if that fine gentleman had taken his oath of it a fellow that ain't to be trusted observed the captain
from the moment of first sight said louis the fine spark was lighted on the euston square platform and it was not much later with her
had been planned twenty years since when poor henry's increasing family and growing difficulties had decided her that she could do without them one year more
there's master james as pleased and proud of that there little brown girl as if she was as fine a boy as master henry himself
not that i regret or resent what concerns myself but it was his leaving me a burden on my grandmother that drove me to become a clergyman and a consistent one i will be not an idle heir apparent to this estate receiving it as his gift not my own birthright
but you taught me all the perseverance i ever had
since isabel had lost marianne and other appliances she had thought it not worth while to dress for dinner so nothing had happened except that the hermit had proved to be adeline's great uncle and had begun to clear up the affair of the sacrilege
such being rosita's ideas on the point mary gave up much hope in her influence and tried what a good humoured announcement of her re establishment of the english breakfast would effect towards bringing her father to a tete a tete but he never came near it
if i am to claim isabel openly why am i not to visit her openly
and your uncle could not wish you to do anything unhandsome by the trustees i wish him to do nothing ma'am said oliver
isabel is satisfied she never desired anything but a quiet simple useful life
exclaimed she no wonder he was angry and ready to impute anything
maternal love did not develop into unwearied delight in infant companionship nor exclusive interest in baby smiles and while she had great visions for the future education of her little maidens she was not desirous to prolong the time spent in their society but in general preferred peace and sir hubert
fanshawe was a comfortable portly personage chiefly absorbed in her caps and her good cheer and faring smoothly through life on the principle of always saying what was expected of her and never seeing anything to anybody's disadvantage
it had been a false greatness but they could not grant the elevation of mind that had originally conceived it
the separation of the families had not diminished the income of the household but the difference in comfort was great
no thank you sir said louis i am afraid my company brought no good luck last time
i am not likely to think it wrong whatever you may
beyond lay an expanse of parched brown turf here and there an enclosure of unprosperous trees and full in front stood the wide space of stuccoed wall with a great gothic window full in the midst and battlements in the castellated style of the early years of the nineteenth century
no my dear i am getting past being teased she said
you know it is not a young rose and lily beauty that i love it is the honest earnest glance in my mary's eyes the rest and trust and peace whenever i do but come near her
as if i would have come near the place if i had known it
i can give her near double what ponsonby could
she augured great things from the letter which she had entrusted to mary and in which she had spoken of lord fitzjocelyn in the highest terms her vocabulary could furnish
jem should have his rights and uncle oliver would learn to love and honour him at last and she was a good child and ought to have been prepared if granny could have guessed he would do it so publicly and suddenly but she must forgive him for he was beside himself at having got them home again and he could not make enough of her because she was poor henry's child
she declares that northwold is her best cure and i am speculating whether she will prevail
but oh said charlotte to herself as she spent her daily five minutes at noonday in quiet thought am i not a poor silly thing not to be thankful that care has been round me this time and that i have not been let to do nothing giddy nor false by tom whatever i may have thought
mr ward came and told her some of the observations made on them by distinguished travellers and after an earnest conversation she sought her matted bed with a pleasant feeling on her mind as if she had been unusually near louis's world
good bye louis i will not forget your messages to tom madison
vexations don't hurt me as much as love does me good and they'll not forget their affection
if mary is good enough for him she will go out and wait till her father comes round
i must see and talk to the man myself but i won't have anything that's not open and above board and that my lady shall see for once in her life
i deserved distrust by my wretched folly and fickleness last year but i did not know what you were to me then my most precious one
a little sauciness on my part has the best effect when anything is wanted for my uncle is very kind to me in his own fashion which is not mine
it was the year 13
i don't want you to do anything
she did i suppose he found she did not help she was broken
did i not tell you that he expressly warns me against you
she found that this was only the first floor of the wondrous castle
delaford had found him on his knees to her and that my lady had snatched her cruelly away because she would not have her married before her own daughters and looked over all the post for fear there should be a letter for her
there was no lack of sympathy here indeed there might be rather too much for she did not afford the softening influence that james had hitherto found at home
if it was pride and delight to her to watch his graceful agile figure spring on horseback she would keep herself from the window lest he should feel oppressed by her pursuing him and when she found her advice sought after as his law she did not venture to proffer it
to be sure she was aware that a serpent lurked among the flowers but she had shown him a bit of her mind once and she found she could take care of herself and keep him at a distance
at least i trust that jane has been the greatest blessing marianne herself speaks of her as more than a mother to her and i believe i told you of the poor girl's overpowering gratitude when she found we would not turn her out to die homeless
but when mary found her thoughts taking this turn she rose up as she lay clasped her hands together and repeated half aloud again and again be thou my all
she never found people tiresome she could find something kind to say to and for the silliest and when my uncle's display was most provoking she would only laugh at poor oliver's odd notions of doing her honour
she cried when she spoke of it and i have seen her in tears at church and found her eyes red when she had been alone but i don't think it was a hard cruel sorrow i think the sunshine of her nature managed to beam through it
he found that there was no staggering her on the score of the life that awaited her she knew more on that subject than he did had confidence in her father and no dread of rosita and she was too much ashamed and grieved at the former effect of his persuasions to attend to any more of a like description
he might have guessed that she understood something by the sudden way in which she curtailed her grandmother's rapturous and affectionate inquiries about the wedding ran upstairs on the plea of taking off her bonnet and appeared no more till he had gone home when coming down she found granny with tearful eyes lamenting that mr
in effect it was a step that no one could have recommended and when your noble relative put it to me in so many words whether i would counsel your continuing your journey i could not take it on me to urge a measure so painful to your feelings unaware as i was then of the amiable qualities of the lady who occupies the situation of the highly beloved and esteemed mary could not bear to hear her mother's name in his mouth so she cut him short by saying i suppose you thought you acted for the best mr
i suppose not i cannot tell
i suppose he ia not come in from school
you had not gone she was one comforts that she indicated they had done for we had
and by the morning though mary's cheek was very white and her eyes sunken for want of sleep she had a cheerful word for her father and a smile the very sight of which would have gone to the heart of any one of those from whom he had cut her off
no said clara she never did but i am convinced that if she had known how soon she was to leave us she would have done so
she undertook the not very hopeful task of teaching a tiny negro imp who answered the purpose of a bell to read and work and she was persevering in her efforts to get xavier and dolores to make her father comfortable
she had to form her habits for herself for her importance in the house was gone but she went to work resolutely and lonely as she was she had far more resources than if she had never been at ormersfield
said clara one comfort is they don't like that said james
could you not have done penance
one bunch of the silver flowers on my skirt was wrong she spied it and they would not thwart her so she would have the needle and the skeleton trembling fingers set them right
till secure of his consent she would not consider her engagement as more than conditional nor consent to its being mentioned to any one
he then came towards her and said in a very kind tone isabel my dear i sent for you first because i knew your own mother very well my dear and though lady conway is very kind and has always done you justice that i will always say for her yet there are times when it may make a difference to a young woman whether she has her own mother or not
the few domestic cares that she perceived to be her duty were gone through as weary tasks and her mind continued involved in her own romantic world where she was oblivious of all that was troublesome or vexatious
are they being done
one breathes freely said she as they left the house
for the first time she had aroused one of mr
an offer she would as soon have expected one from her father
he could not win from her one of her broad fearless comments on his past doings and in his present business the taking possession of inglewood the choice of stock and the appointment of a bailiff though she listened and sympathized and answered questions she volunteered no opinions ahe expressed no wishes she would not come to see
forgive me for speaking thus she added i know that it may wound you now but there may come a time when it may make you feel more at ease and unfettered and i could not endure to imagine that the affection which you brought yourself to lavish on one so unworthy should stand in the way of your happiness for life
isabel was a high minded wife but she would have been a still better one if her loving admiration had allowed her to soften james or to question whether pride and rancour did not lurk unperceived in the midst of the really high and sound motives that prompted him
and you she cried why could not you speak up like a man and tell them that i thank none of them and will have nothing to say to any of them and that if this is to belong to any one it must be to my noble my glorious generous brother and if he hasn't it it may go to the queen for what i care
martha's very house and when there was so much to be done she took the most violent fit of novel reading that had ever been known and when engaged in working or cleaning alone chanted dismal ballads of the type of alonzo the brave and the fair imogens till mrs
yet whatever she might say no one would believe her so she held her peace and wrote her history of the silver mines and mr
it was not falsehood it was real amiability and it was an infinite comfort in the courtship especially the courtship of a pendragon
no i shall not defend her i shall go to give her what comfort i can
this odious frivolous young man of fashion so entirely disconcerted her ideas of ardent lovers or of self interested puppies that she gazed at him surprised and softened and when he looked at her anxiously to judge whether mary would find in her a kind comforter her eyes were full of tears and she said as they left the room it must be a great relief to my poor mary that you see it so sensibly
one afternoon as mary sat in her window reading a gay voice exclaimed beso las manos a usted and looking up she saw one of the prettiest figures imaginable
i don't mean that she repented of the actions but of the motives she said the glory of being beholden to no one had run through everything and had been very hurtful even to uncle oliver
this pretty disguise was a freak such as only the most gay ladies permitted themselves and she had little doubt that her father would be extremely displeased at his wife and daughter so appearing although danger there was none since though any one might accost a female thus veiled not the slightest impertinence was ever allowed
then she was full of hope and eager ardour to arrive longing for the parental presence of which she had so long been deprived hailing every novel scene as a proof that she was nearer home and without the anticipation of one cloud only expecting to be loved to love and to be useful
she had slumbered away without revival or suffering as one who did rest from her labours and her eyes had been closed on the previous night
mary think dynevor had tied in father
in this mind mary met lord ormersfield
dynevor mary cried out with surprise
i think your father has a prize in him
and when shall i not think mary
i think you should said mary gravely
i shall think you lost to all feeling for your father if you say another word about it
i don't think it did said mary considering i don't think she ever knew how much i cared
was all mary could say as there rushed over her the thought of the wonderful changes this would make in dynevor terrace
why mary i did not think a girl of your sense could be so taken in
ward and yet your father encouraged me to hope that in course of time then papa has told you what he thinks
it was to the father mother and young brother and sisters whose graves had been hastily made far away in the time of the pestilence the only dynevors who did not lie in the tombs of their fathers
my dear father said louis it was mary and her mother who first taught me my own obligations
it had been an old promise to mary from her father to take her to see them but in her former residence in peru it had never been fulfilled
mary i think that you are committing your way unto the lord and you know he shall bring it to pass
don't think i'm too glad to go away but i cannot but be thankful that my dear boy is bringing me home to lay me down where my father and his father lie
but i must think for you
it did not occur to his lordship that he was straining pretty hard the filial duty of his own son while he was arguing that mary should snap asunder the same towards her father
all the rest of the negro establishment came round capering and chattering spanish and in the confusion mary could not get her question heard where was her father
anything that drew her father nearer to her was received with gratitude by mary and the words of kindness in some degree softened the blow
he was so wealthy and prosperous and a connexion with him would have been so useful to the firm that mary was grateful to her father for forbearing to press her on what he evidently wished so earnestly
mary roused herself at last to speak as she moved downstairs you need not think of me there is nothing the matter with me
you will plead for me i think you will and when he is satisfied that we are no rebels then the first ship that sails for peru say that will do mary
i thought it would have been delightful to have him married one could be so much more at ormersfield and mary would be so nice but as to their being over persuaded and thinking themselves half wrong
if he began declaring that nothing would ever make him feel disconnected with mary he was told that it was not time to think of that and they must not waste their time
it seemed to be forgiveness consolation strength all at once and their words mingled papa you forgive me mary my good girl i did not think they would have let you come back to me
lord ormersfield had pity on him and went in search of mary while he remembering former passages felt that his father might be less startling and more persuasive but began to understand what james must have suffered in committing his affairs to another
and his father made answer at liverpool yesterday and how the custom house had detained them and he had therefore brought mary straight home instead of stopping with her at northwold at eleven o'clock to disturb mrs
papa i don't think you know i've written him a civil answer if that's what you mean much civiller than he or his father deserve he said speaking loud and trying to fling away from her but she stood her ground and spoke calmly and
said james i am told so whenever my father sees me receive a note said louis wearily but i see that habituated as he is to living alone he is never really at ease unless i am in the way so i make our hours agree as far as our respective treadmills permit and though we do not speak much i can never think in company
you see said mary
he was very much what he is now said mary
father father you would not be so cruel
menorot.com cmyonge.htm dynevor terrace
dynevor had some plans about james and me
mrs roland dynevor i presume
to me dynevor terrace is home said james
dynevor never poor oliver
roland dynevor would find it compensation
but oh dynevor terrace without you
meantime there was a lull at dynevor terrace
f dynevor had come into a large fortune
frost of dynevor terrace
it was not much brighter at dynevor terrace
but don't go off about that now though tis the reason i won't part from the poor thing till i can help the better luck for you that you'd got more in your head than vanities and furbelows
in the first place nothing could be fixed without further letters although the earl had tried to persuade mary that her father had virtually forfeited all claim to her obedience and that she ought to proceed as if in fact an orphan and secure herself from being harassed by him by hastening her marriage
with mary gone he cared little what became of him until her letters could arrive and his father with more attention to his supposed benefit than to his wishes carried him at once without returning home to a round of visits among all his acquaintance most likely to furnish a distracting amount of christmas gaieties
but one burning tropical noon the valdivia was entering callao harbour and mary sick and faint at heart was arraying herself in a coloured dress lest her mourning should seem to upbraid her father
here the path narrowed and mary had to fall back out of hearing but she had an unpleasant suspicion that robson was telling her father something to tom's disadvantage and she had to consider how to avoid rousing a jealousy which she knew might be dangerous
lord ormersfield and mary here broke out in amazement at themselves for having hitherto been oblivious of the intelligence that had greeted them on their first arrival when frampton had informed them of lord fitzjocelyn's wound and gallant conduct and his father had listened to the story like the fastening of a rivet in miss conway's chains and mary with a flush of unselfish pride that isabel had been taught to value her hero
does his father object
oh what is it father
my father commanded me
father well he asked
if only we had your dear father
his heart fainted as he thought of years without the strength and soothing which her very letter breathed forth as he pictured to himself alternations between his chill and stately home and the weary maze of london foresaw persuasions from his father to induce him to form some new attachment and dreaded to think of the facility with which perhaps he might still be led out of his own convictions
what could the clerk be thinking of
did his father forbid when your father refused your portion
frost dynevor to the little black tutor
dynevor had already written before receiving mine
dynevor by the same mail for an explanation of the circumstances to which he referred
roland dynevor will own that nothing can exceed it
all she ventured to say had a timid gracefulness and simplicity that were very winning and her husband glanced more than once to see if she were not gaining upon his daughter and so in truth she was personally though it was exceedingly painful to see her where mary had been used to see that dear suffering face and it was impossible not to feel the contrast with her father as painfully incongruous
frost dynevor was graciously pleased to accept him as a worthy relation
i wonder if he'll find old dynevor grateful
to be engraved with the dynevor crest as before or would you prefer the lozenge ma'am
dynevor of cheveleigh and james was equally resolved that she should be only mrs
but mary mary you cannot be bound by this
oh mary mary this is too much
my father where he is not come down
i thought her father was dead
you have never believed how fond she is of her father
to insult my father and his choice
don't doubt my father i will fetch him
i do not hear that he has been to blame as a father
she must choose between us and her father
my love to your father and aunt catharine
said rosita if my father would only consent
we could not have been happy in disobeying my father
her father was decidedly glad of her company
like her father that's right
she give them have a out of his spite
never mind jem i verily believe that in spite of absence and all that she had never been so happy in her life
she felt herself come at length to the shelter and repose for which her heart had so long yearned in spite of her efforts and as if the world had nothing more to offer of peace or joy
and she tells me she would give fifty pounds rather than bring charlotte here
so she saw granny must not be grieved and she let herself be dressed for a constrained dinner in the vast dining room where the servants outnumbered the diners and the silver covers bore the dynevor dragon as a handle looking as spiteful as some of the race could do
only give him time
i knew his happiness depended on his success and i worked for him in spite of himself
you'll stand by your father in spite of all the house of peers
isabel was always ready to give warm aid and sympathy in all his higher cares and purposes and her mild tranquillity was repose and soothing to him but she was like one in a dream
how can you give in to such shuffling nonsense
if he were a stranger i should give the same advice
he cannot be desiring you to give me up
i would give the world to think so clara
if you are in any authority over them it must give you a charge over their souls
i do believe upon my word it is all to spite poor dear master oliver
she says the subject has never been broached since the flight from northwold and that lady conway's kindness never varies and she told me she had little fear but that her dear mamma would be prevailed on to give sanction enough to hinder her from feeling as if she were doing wrong or setting a bad example to her sisters
shall i go back and give your answer
on one head i shall give warning
come to dinner louis and give us an excuse
i shall give an order as i pass through london
i am come to ask if you will kindly give me a dinner
the suspicion crossed him that it was a new generation without memories of forty years since wondering rather than welcoming in spite of arches bells and shouts
no no i can't leave the girl to her brother he'd teach her his own nasty spiteful temper and waste the property on all those brats
anger might give one spirits he said smiling mournfully
i give him up because you command me father but i will not hear him spoken of unjustly
ha ha so long as you give him up we won't quarrel
i think you should at least give them the choice of reading the service with you
give me again my hollow tree my crust of bread and liberty
hem said the earl gravely i am afraid this fellow ponsonby will give us some trouble
it is only fair towards him towards all of us to give him time to answer our letters
but he knew they ought not to be bound under such uncertainties and his conviction was too strong to give way to emotion
i give jem credit for having secured a first rate governess for you
suppose you came begging and imploring me not to give any umbrage to the man because you so doted upon diamonds
after a pause jem my dear could you manage to give your uncle the true account of your marriage
i can tell him he need not be in no hurry about giving warning to lady conway
james take her up and give her some tea and make her fit to behave prettily by and by that granny may not be vexed
i am asking lady conway to give you a bed to morrow night clara he said
it is my belief said fitzjocelyn in his peculiar way that the worst injury you could do to james would be to give way to the spirit that has possessed him
mr ponsonby was a large man with the jovial manner of one never accustomed to self restraint good birth and breeding making him still a gentleman in spite of his loud voice and the traces of self indulgence
the marriage was fixed for the end of november so as to give time for a little tranquillity before the commencement of james's new duties
mrs frost was deeply touched and gratified and lord ormersfield congratulated himself on having instigated oliver to give this toast to mr
you can guess how he is everything to us all said aunt kitty and i brightened up his looks with giving him your last letter to read
frost had ever made soon after the orphans came under her charge giving the terrace to james and dividing the money in the funds between the two
the sunday teaching was treated as especially obnoxious the genteel mothers talked ridiculously about its resembling a charity school the fathers did not care whether their sons went or not and he had scarcely five boys who appeared there regularly and of them one was the butcher's son who came rather in spite of his parents than with their consent
but they were too much accustomed to be on respectfully quarrelsome terms to alter their regard for one retort more or less and after all there were very few men whom lord ormersfield liked or esteemed half so much as the fearless and uncompromising james frost james frost as he curtly signed himself in spite of all louis's wit on rolands and olivers and yet those soft satirical speeches did more than all direct attacks to shake his confidence in his own magnanimity more especially because fitzjocelyn always declared himself incompetent to judge and never failed to uphold that he was so far right that his ministry must stand above all worldly considerations
mansell who had treated him with respect and cordiality from the first giving him to understand that isabel's further expectations only amounted to a legacy of a couple of thousands on his own death and that meantime he had little or no hope of helping him in his profession
and before he could sleep that night he wrote a letter to tom madison warning him to let no temptation nor bad example lead him aside from strict justice and fair dealing and advising him rather to come home and give up all prospects of rising than not preserve his integrity
my own dear and precious aunt to see her so happy with bliss and peace so undisturbed so far above these toys and these distresses gives me a sort of fear oh don't louis they were interrupted by approaching voices
mary stood in the large dark room with the soft matted floor and the windows high up near the carved timbered ceiling the single lamp burning in rum casting a dim gleam over the well known furniture by which her mother had striven to give an english appearance to the room
she acquiesced in my judgment that she could do no otherwise than return
she used to wish she could settle there with how little consciousness
she could imagine the whole reciprocated and she feared to be importunate
she is a sensible girl and will understand me when she has recovered the shock
does she walk poor child she _must_
she held it out proudly and mr
just like her just as she wheedled poor conway
she was very young and mr
she has been suffering much in anticipation of this meeting
if she would but have spared herself yesterday
he has sent for her and she is going
she lighted mary and mr
then she wrote her letters
he was oliver and she had him again
she said my poor oliver
i see it now she said holding his hand between both of hers
she died in india
it is his own fault she said
returned oliver she was attached to you
how she did love uncle oliver
it have made you was grown top her had seen to like she ate
then you would like her to go out
she felt what she had often heard said that to all mountain tops is given somewhat of the glory that dwelt on sinai
mary went on in very comfortable discussion of the wonders they had seen and of madison's remark that the performances of the incas made one quite ashamed of the achievements of modern science a saying in which mr
she had known the worst she had been borne through by heart whole faith and love she had seen how often frettings for the future were vain and experienced that anticipation is worse than reality
you would waste your best years and when the time came you would still be young and i grown into an old careworn woman
have you ever seen cheveleigh mrs
the diamonds the french millinery and jane's motherly care came in strong contrast to the miserable lodging or the consumptive hospital which poor marianne had begun to anticipate and weeping with gratitude she declared that she had never seen nor thought of such kindness since her mother died
all that depended on her had been well done but it would not seem to have occurred to her mistress that three people ate more than two and to louis who had been too busy to take any luncheon the two dishes seemed alarmingly small
one was of haricot mutton the other of potatoes and charlotte might be seen to blush as she carried lord fitzjocelyn the plate containing a chop resembling indian rubber decorated with grease and with two balls of nearly raw carrot and followed it up with potatoes apparently all bruises
that is over now said oliver consequentially and as his mother presented to him poor henry's little clara he kissed her affectionately saying well grown young lady upon my word
and how should the communication be made
you may forgive you are his mother and you were injured but i can never forget what i have seen you undergo
and mrs frost went to pay a visit at beauchastel and the cook enjoyed a course of gaieties the only use she made of her liberty was to drink tea once with mrs
alas she loved honoured and admired him as her upright unselfish uncompromising husband but worries and rebukes and tart answers had made many a rent in the veil in which her fancy had enfolded him
once when much music and talk was going on he came and sat by her and made her tell him how fondly and affectionately she had parted with her schoolfellows and how some of her old foes had become as she hoped friends for life but she saw his eye fixed and absent even while she spoke and she left off suddenly
i may rest now i have told you and seen you not angry with poor papa nor with me
as the train dashed up to one of these a flag was seen waving and the shout of cheveleigh cheveleigh road
how christmas passed with clara may be seen in the following letter cheveleigh jan
murmured mary he could have poured forth a torrent of affection but the suspicion of a footstep made her start from him and the next moment she was herself glowing indeed and half crying with happiness but alarmed at her own agitation and struggling to resume her common place manner
james made no answer
you have made us take very deep root here
he has attained his object and made the most of it
ponsonby's gusts of passion she quailed under it wept bitterly and made innumerable promises and then she put on her black mantilla and with xavier behind her went to her convent chapel and returned half crying over the amount of repetitions of her rosary by which her penance was to be performed and thereby all sense of the fault put away
i don't know what made him think it possible but he does
never was a man who made a more unlucky error in judgment
i believe it made very little difference to her said clara
well i had looked to see her made happy by harmony between those two
the english breakfast which had been established much to his content by her own exertions had quite vanished each of the family had a cup of chocolate in private and there was no meeting till late in the morning rosita sauntered into her room embraced her made inquiries as to her rest informed her that she was going to the opera that night and begged her to accompany her
and as his father came up his last words were in his own bright tone tell granny from me that giraffes ought always to be seen by gaslight
dynevor's letter had certainly not had much effect for mary was more lively and cheerful than he had seen her since her first arrival
dark figures could be distinctly seen moving about and as to the descending mules they seemed to be close on the other side of a narrow ravine
i have all the trouble in the world to be allowed to go about fit to be seen and only by means of great fighting and coaxing did i prevail to have my dress only from london instead of paris
if you could have seen the poor thing with her short breath and racking cough her cheeks burning and her eyes glistening at that flimsy trumpery
the electricity of the atmosphere made jokes easily pass current
greeted them on the platform stood a tall footman in the most crimson of coats powdered hair and a stupendous crimson and white shoulder knot auch as clara had only seen going to st
here and there the engine house of a mine rose up among shabby buildings and by and by was seen a square church tower with lofty pinnacles among which floated forth a flag
her uncle could just be seen in the far perspective at the head of the table and between him and the earl louis descried his aunt catharine looking bright with a little embellishing flush on her withered cheek
to tell you the truth i can't stand your being with her again while i am made a fool of by that woman
humph said oliver with a dry sound apparently expressing so that is what our parliament is made of
james made hasty answer that they had already received their names mercy and salome
they were that the gentleman would be wasted on the school and that the lady was not made for a poor man's wife
james frost's letter of fiery indignation almost of denunciation made her thankful that he was not the party concerned and louis made her smile at isabel's copy of all his sentiments in ladylike phrases
louis took up the subject eagerly and isabel entered into the discussion with all her soul and the grammar school did indeed seem to be in a way to become something very superior in tone to anything northwold had formerly seen engrossing as it did all the powers of a man of such ability in the full vigour of youth
no as he told me he knew the way ponsonby had gone on ever since his wife went home and of late he had sent him to guayaquil about the equatorial navigation so he had seen nothing and says he to me he had no notion of bringing out poor miss ponsonby did not know whether her father would thank him and yet the best of it is that he pacifies ponsonby with talking of difficulty of dealing with preconceived notions
mind captain said louis it wasn't _i_ that made the boat late this time last year
louis made no objection and james hurried him into the little parlour where in ten minutes the note was dashed off my own most precious one
he never did said isabel indignant enough to disclose in full the whole arrangement made by lady conway's manoeuvres and lax good nature
i am so far his inferior in cleverness and everything attractive and have been made so like his elder sister that it might not have been best for him
rosita replied earnestly to that effect and warmly embraced mary pitying her for such an arrival and hoping that dolores had made her comfortable
it was all with such innocent earnest pleasure that mary could not be annoyed and good naturedly made all her disappointing display
frost is a glorious name to me recording my grandmother's noble exertions on our behalf but i can imagine it to be hateful to him recalling the neglect that made her slaving necessary
hole but cork jem frost look when he is come away
no wonder he was in a passion but just imagine what it would be to heed half jem frost says when he is well worked up
james frost dynevor away at eleven next morning and therefore did isabel look up in a sudden fit of recollection as the breakfast was being removed and say charlotte delaford is coming on tuesday to fetch me to estminster and will sleep here that night
because jem frost was in love with her himself he fancied every one else must be the same and now he will be married to her before christmas so that's disposed of
frost gazed on it as it came forth more distinctly and clara looked with a sense of awe but rending her away from grave thoughts shouts burst upon her ears and above them the pealing crash of all the bells as they dashed under a splendid triumphal arch all evergreens and dahlias forming the word welcome
and what makes him come and hide in holes and corners if this is all with your mamma's good will
it is all goodness in jem and poor oliver will understand it when i have got him into our home ways again but he has been so long away from home poor fellow
he was really happy here the careworn look smoothed away the sharpness left his tones and there was nothing but joyous exultation and fondness in his whole manner
he was ruddy and bronzed and his eyebrows and hair looked as if touched by hoar frost altogether as dissimilar a partner as could be devised for the slender girlish being by his side
frost look for a face she knew and inquire from her new acquaintance after familiar old names of places and people
jem dear jem what are you saying
those looks can only be for you
i must look up to you
where here in the hall with jem
frost shut her eyes to restrain the hot tears that arose at the thought of the wintry morning when ice drops hung hoary on the fir trees as she had driven away from the portal whence music was now pealing forth a greeting and where oliver was standing on the very spot where with clenched hand he had vowed that all should be restored
frost tenderly there is an m
frost he will take my side
jem you may be proud
but jem you could be so useful in the parish
and yet jem does want to do right
i'm going home to jem
but i can't thrust out jem
but jem has my uncle said anything
then glad emerge we to the cheering day some sun ranged height or alpine snowy crown or chimborazo towering far away o'er the great andes chain and looking down on flaming cordilleras mountain thrown o'er mountain vast new realms
louis was after him with a face more than half arch fun jem jem it is your uncle
ah jem jem oliver little knew the damage his neglect did you
lester is going to retire and jem has the school
no it won't you will be thinking of jem and isabel
take care jem it is oliver and no mistake
extremely flattering now jem don't be angry
oh jem can't i still live here and only visit there
mrs frost was less manageable
james frost if you please
frost they have managed to be very happy here
frost i should think mrs
frost begged him to use his influence with james
james frost out of her senses
james frost with comfort
frost was severe or that he was partial
frost would be a little more gentle with the boys
you look ill it has been too much for you
you look very ill
how does louisa look
jem never did he and my aunt held back and were unwilling to oppose the squire
home i'm like jem jealous for this old house
cried mrs frost between laughing and crying what has he been about
i could not look in her face
my note was to tell them so and look here mr
you do not look so said clara earnestly
then why do you look so grave and uneasy
you shall look just as you please if you will only stay
i shall look sharp after him then
i look on clara as my own
i shall keep a sharper look out after him
the earl looked doubtfully at james
i can look to the equatorial company here must do without me out there
cried jem beginning to rush off but louis caught and imprisoned his arm
father i never supposed you could be averse to my doing my utmost for jem when all his prospects were at stake
granny and isabel are walking and will end by picking up jem coming out of school
jem told me grandmamma claimed my first duty but he never knew of this wicked plan
oh jem said clara clasping her hands to keep them from trembling i never thought of that
but louis cried clara wildly astonished i must go i can't have jem saying these things of me
well jem said louis at last i think you should keep your hands off the boys
why unluckily he fancied he had some claim on me on the score of jem frost's election
frost beside her shrank from ormersfield like forbidden ground
the only condition he says on which he could allow me to remain would be if i were engaged to james frost
said mrs frost i like anything that makes louis happy
frost louis fitzjocelyn not much like the fitzjocelyn you remember but a new m
frost reproached herself with asking too much of her proud sensitive grandson
pray are the houses henceforth to be frost terrace or arctic row
frost kindly withheld from her granddaughter in the hope of a reconciliation
frost apologizing poor oliver's notions were on such a grand scale
mrs frost bowed her thanks and waved her hand
frost anxious to do her the last honours by attending the funeral
i only stumbled over an obstruction on the frost staircase yesterday aaid louis
frost intolerably impertinent i hope you set him down
frost nor i should wish him to pretermit his duty on any consideration whatever
visit is not look she was felt for s to boston mary property
then mary felt her hand pressed to his lips but she would not unclose her burning eyes she would fain sleep beneath the impress of that spell of patient confidence
of this mary believed two sentences namely that aunt catharine doted on fitzjocelyn and that he was not so soft as he looked which she took as an admission that he was not comporting himself foolishly
mr ward having visited it came back bent on taking her thither there was no danger if she were not afraid
clara's countenance returned him a look of sorrowful reproach for thinking her capable of being amused when he was in distress and she sat in silent musings all the way home pondering over his words speculating on his future wondering what mary felt and becoming blunt and almost angry when her grave escort in the opposite corner consulted civility by addressing some indifferent remark to her as if she said to herself she were no better than a stuffed giraffe and knew and cared nothing about anybody
for his own part he was little used to ladies society and could form no judgment of the bride but he could assure lord ormersfield that she had been guilty of no impropriety she was visited by every one and that there was no reason against mary ponsonby associating with her
it is my resolute purpose that not one farthing of mine shall go to patch up the broken down ormersfield property
the hut was at least clean said robson as he ushered them in and mary felt as if it were a great deal more
she noted likewise that isabel was backward in entering into details of her home life and that she never said a word to encourage her sister's wishes to visit her at northwold
they all drove together in the willises carriage up the sloping road from callao to lima and mary heard astonishment such as she had once felt breaking out in screams from the children at the sight of omnibuses filled with gaily dressed negroes and brown horsewomen in panama hats and lace edged trousers careering down the road
he still felt fondly brotherly and compassionate and all the more because she had proved more weak against temptation than he had expected
does not the drawing room look nice
the young man is not so soft as he looks
nothing roused her she did not perceive omissions that would have fretted women of housewifely instincts and her soft dignity and smooth temper felt few annoyances and though james could sometimes be petulant he was always withheld from reproving her both by his enthusiastic fondness and his sense that for him she had quitted her natural station of ease and prosperity
james such a queen as she looks among them
and charlotte too she looks half dead
all i am clear about is that even a red republican is less red than he is painted that isabel conway is fit to visit the sentinels in a beleaguered castle a noble being but oh mary
can't leave that child alone with the property
mary you here they said you were not at home
you do not know all said mary
her lively frank tone of playful command had passed away nay she almost shrank from his confidence withheld her counsel and discouraged his constant visits
no seriously i must confess that she looked uncommonly well and lovely
mr henderson and she eagerly started up but looked baffled
puffed up as they are about these speculations he imagines me to have brought mary home for no purpose but to repair our fortunes and informs me that in the event of your marriage she will receive not a farthing beyond her mother's settlements
it seems his family property was in the market and he was anxious to secure it
the senora was swinging in a hammock half asleep with a cigarette between her lips all the morning and when she emerged from this torpid state in a splendid toilette she had too many more congenial friends often to need her step daughter in her visits her expeditions to lotteries and her calls on her old friends the nuns
my mary she will have a happier lot than her mother
no air forsooth she who had often heard it said that she looked like any lady
every time she felt herself the elder in heart every time she feared to have disappointed him every time she saw that his liveliness was repressed by her mournfulness she feared that she was letting him sacrifice himself
dynevor's visit to england and the quantity of work this temporary absence entailed on him and then on the surprise it would be to his patron to find her and senora rosita's interest in her and the numerous gaieties of the bride and the admiration she excited and his own desire to be useful
the places were either become factories or some charming new family lived there and for the people it seemed as if she might as well aak for antediluvians lady britton had seldom heard their names or if any trace survived they had never been on her visiting list
even the faithfull sisters were kept in ignorance and she trusted thus to diminish the wrong that she felt her secrecy to be doing to aunt melicent who was so much vexed and annoyed at her return that she dreaded exceedingly the effect of the knowledge of her engagement
i shall try to set it for a reward for myself to cure me of repinings said mary looking into his face as if the remembrance of it must bring cheerfulness and refreshment
mary had once on a like occasion only said it was very cold and looked to see whether the captain expected the monster to bear down on the ship
by and by looking like a string of ants descending a perpendicular wall mary beheld a row of black specks slowly moving
mary you will not disappoint my poor boy again
he could not have waited six weeks but i must go to mary
oh how weak i was ever to listen no mary that must not be said
papa is not like james said mary things go deeper with him
and oh mary i don't wonder you do not trust it
i do not mean to mention him again said mary i wish to obey you
mansell's displeasure with her for not having taken better care of her she dreaded a break and so on till the end of it was that though we agree that prudence would carry us off to morrow morning yet her ladyship will look the other way if you happen to be on the southern beach at eleven o'clock to morrow morning
mr ponsonby was growing tired of these constant gaieties and generally remained at home sending mary in his stead as a sort of guard over her and mary always the same in her white muslin followed rosita through all the salas of lima listened to the confidences of limenian beauties talked of england to little naval cadets more homesick than they would have chosen to avow and felt sure of some pleasure and interest for the evening when mr
i saw at once that you felt as i did and as i know he will
ponsonby and felt that he had spoken too soon
just puts woman she did not see on not having pretty robson
he never forgets i shall never forgive myself for not having spoken to robson
james will not be put into it
that will never be whatever woman he chooses will she could not go on but presently cleared her voice no i should like to leave him quite free
isabel had not found out that having duties and not doing them was less practical than having no particular task
no mary i will not hear the nonsense they have put into your head my poor girl
she went down stairs still in a glow and her old friend's first words were a compliment on her roses so pointed that she doubted for a moment whether he did not think them suspicious especially as he put his hands behind his back and paced up and down the room for some moments
isabel did not like to come to more individual inquiries lest she should prepare discomfort for charlotte but she easily satisfied herself that all was as right as convenient and having occasion to write some orders to charlotte communicated the proposal saying that all should be settled on her return
too scrupulous said james in an undertone while his uncle was explaining to his mother that he could not have come away without leaving robson to manage his affairs and mr
mr robson and the sumpter mules had quietly preceded them and the gipsying on the andes was likely to be not much less luxurious than an english pic nic
that question was soon at rest isabel would be but too happy to be allowed to share her home and truly james would hardly have attached himself to a woman who could not regard it as a privilege to be with the noble old lady
yes you must come to morrow said mary in a tone he could not interpret and a tight lingering grasp on his hand as he put her into his father's carriage
i am grieved enough to say so repeated louis but as he puts it i do not see how mary can refuse to obey him
lord ormersfield attributed his tranquillity to having his mind settled and so it was though not quite as his lordship imagined
mary had come in for some of the anger for not having prevented rosita's expedition but they were both speedily forgiven and mary never was informed again of her using the saya y manto
i hope you will begin your sunday scheme but granny fears the bad set will not care and the good will prefer having their families together
after his good bye he turned back again to say i'm selfish but let me put you in mind not to let the lima correspondence drop
sometimes when he bids me good night he puts his arm round me and says so pitifully that i do not care for him
oh i am making no objection sir returned robson the young man may take his pleasure for what i care so he can be trusted not to neglect his business
he is not himself
ponsonby's views should be known but she was only laughed at for her english precision and the pretty creature danced away to her stolen pleasure
she looked up with a pretty smile of greeting but he only ran his hand through his already disordered hair and exclaimed our stairs are like the captain of knockdunder's
mary is a woman the only woman i can ever love
you must not tell me not to think
another right do louis'she grown off statement that i
i know it is right
he has the only right to me
i see you right in principle but are you right in spirit
then it would all come right no not right for granny had dreaded his going
if i'm not to see her i'll be off
all right i'm going to her at once
that's right just in time
he was right if i had known all this i should still have brought her home
mary you are right you must go
that's right i won't be uneasy for you
you think james right
tell me you think i am right
she has been insisting on breaking off and all my hope was in you
these young people want to cast off all their neighbours
all actual debate was staved off by mrs
oh louis do not make it harder for me to do right
that's right mary you are a good girl after all
if duty and affection claim a right none have such as he
it was weak and selfish in me to enter into this engagement and it must be broken off
oh louis the gratitude to you the weight off my mind
england is a long way off said rosita languidly he could not have reached you there
come leave off crying marianne he ain't worth it
as the four horses went thundering off with mrs
smithers was playing off and the grave diversion with which louis received them
now i think considering all things she has a right to take her own way
i thought you acted most properly then and as i see him now i think you equally right in accepting him
quite right in one point of view he said with acrimony
you have to choose between right and wrong between his frenzy and his true good
it must be right to cling to my own brother in his noble poverty
it was not right by neither of us so please say no more
he stood hesitating for a moment as it drove off then instead of entering the house walked off quickly in the same direction
if she cast off her family nothing could be better otherwise i would never connect you with them
when i leave off work i shall want you for a companion when i go to work the thought must stir me up
some people would think a sick child more engrossing than that he had very nearly said trash but he broke off short
charlotte crept off to her room and isabel returned to the dinner table
the attendance at his evening lectures had fallen off and he declared that there was a spirit of opposition to whatever he did
i'll tell you what granny lord ormersfield never knew in his life what was right half as well as louis does
as long as i do my duty by their sons what right have they to impose the penance of their society on my wife
your father's own family is unexceptionable and those kind of things so far off few will ever hear of them and no one will attach consequence to them
charlotte only curtsied and thanked but it was wonderful how those kind sympathizing words blew off at once the whole mists of nonsense and fancy
mansell but still louis would not let him off on the plea that james's side of the house should make as imposing a demonstration as possible
what was worse lady conway had paired them off in the order of precedence and louis was a victim to two dowagers between whom he could neither see nor speak to mary
she stood apart while the willis family were in all the rapture of the meeting she saw them moving off too happy and sufficient for themselves even to remember her
i believe that if they saw me fearless and coming among them for friendly purposes they would leave off hooting but the notion frightens granny so i am a prisoner
purvis to refuse the afternoon service when you offered to take all the trouble off hishands granny hopes you will take care what you are about with him
sending ellen down to finish the stairs he carried off the little girl fondling and talking to her and happy in her perfect content
poor charlotte in her hysterics again said isabel moving off quickly for her with the purple scent bottle at her chatelaine
they know nothing of it but walter who learnt it no one knows how draws the exemplary moral that it serves his mother right for inflicting a tutor on him
that's right jem neither as a clergyman nor as a dynevor can i consent to trick even those who have no claim to her duty
she means poor girl what only her own scrupulous delicacy could regard as an objection but what renders me still more desirous to have a right to protect her
for the rest mary is already in feeling so entirely my child that to have the right to call her so has always been my fondest wish
if i did wrong i can only be very sorry but i cannot readily believe that i transgressed by setting the question before people in a right light
continued his father it is the very case where a woman's exaggerated notions of right may be wrought on to do her infinite harm
clara he paused and spoke lower tell her i see what is right now tell her to to pray for me that i may not be talked into tampering with my conscience or with hers
there are very few people in this world half so good or so right minded as fitzjocelyn said mary earnestly and deliberately
i am ready to do whatever you think right i leave you to settle it said isabel moving out of the room that louis might be free for a more intimate conversation
i knew he disliked it at the time of my ordination but if he wished me to act according to his views he should have given himself the right to dictate
it humbled him even now and he answered you may be right louis i may be not sufficiently altered since i was a boy
the black gown and trencher cap by no means gratified oliver when james set off to school on monday morning but he consoled himself with observing we shall soon put an end to that
the worst difficulties of the descent had precluded all conversation and the party were just beginning to breathe freely think of terra firma as not far off and gaze with easier minds on the marvellous ocean
his first was to offer his assistance to the vicar so as to have a third service on the sunday but there were differences of opinion between them and his proposal was received so ungraciously that a coolness arose which cut him off from many openings for usefulness
the smile did not last long for louis was well nigh thrown downstairs by a dustpan in a dark corner and james was heard muttering that nothing in that house was ever in its right place and while louis was suggesting that it was only himself who was not in the right place they entered the drawing room which like the lady was in the same condition as that in which he had left it
she replied that she would never say a word to change his notions of right and she treated poor oliver with all the lofty reserve that she had formerly practised upon possible suitors
you are the man to know what is right only isabel don't help him to hate people more than can possibly be avoided and don't break dear aunt kitty's heart amongst you
his way of life can hardly have taught him to appreciate james's scruples as we do and even if right and wrong were more neatly partitioned between them than i think they are it would still be hard on him to find this destined heir spurning his benefits
the tide would not however serve and as waiting till it would was not to be endured the two cousins set off to walk together through the woods louis beguiling the way by chaffing james as far as he would bear with the idea of isabel's name being trifled with by the profane crowd
i had assented and was devising how to march off my lunatic quietly when the feminine goodnatured heart that is in her began to relent and she looked up in my face with a smile and said the poor dears were really exemplary and if isabel should walk to the beach and should meet any one there she need know nothing about it
said the earl louis turned pale as he read and scarcely breathed as he looked up at his father dreading that he might so resent the studied affronts as to wish to break off the connexion and that he might have him likewise to contend with but on that score he was set at rest
the movements were even more brisk as if time were money and in speech the small change of particles was omitted and every word seemed bitten off short at the end the whole man in gesture manner and voice an almost grotesque caricature of all james's peculiarities
in a wonderfully brief time as it seemed to her all the animals were led off to their quarters and robson coming up explained that madison's hut the only habitable place had been prepared for the ladies the gentlemen must be content to sleep in their tent
fancy jane insisting on my going to display my dress to that poor dying marianne i was shocked at the notion of carrying my frivolities into such a scene but jane said her mind ran on it and it was anything to take off her thoughts from that man
make jem forgive me said clara faintly as her announcement of her purpose when she finally sought her room obliged to be thought meanly of rather than do ill denying her fondest affections cutting herself off from all she loved and with but this consolation that she was doing as grandmamma would have bidden her
i wish your friend madison would come home and take her off our hands for she is always alternating between fits of novel reading and of remorse in which she nearly works herself to death with running after lost time
he left james at the gate of the park prowling about like a panther to try for a glimpse of isabel's window and feeding his despair and jealousy that louis should boldly walk up to the door while he with so much better a right was excluded by his unguarded promise to lady conway
all the tumultuary emotions of his mind were endlessly repeated and many a slow and pealing note of the church clock had added fuel to his impatience and spurred him to rush up to the door and claim his rights before louis came bounding past the lodge gates flourishing his cap and crying hurrah jem
in have been very to convey company but on have softened doll one
mr ponsonby professed to have been unwilling to enter so speedily on the new tie but to have been compelled by the species of persecution which was exercised on rosita in order to make her return to her nunnery
certainly no one wished to have her company there again
if any description could convey the sweetness of voice and manner when she spoke of you
james sighed and looked softened and thoughtful
i shall be better company when i have had my sulk out
the earl was so softened and sorrowful that clara hardly knew him
i came yesterday and what company do you think i had in the train as far as estminster
and you let yourself be drawn into calling it mary's duty to run into such company as that
oliver had two ideas cheveleigh and the equatorial steam navigation company and on these he rang the changes
besides as jane said i can't be accountable for taking her into that large family until i see what company there may be
suffering by their own fault would have rent them asunder more harshly and louis's freedom from all fierceness and violence softened all ineffably to mary
tempers such as those in which the uncle and nephew but too closely resembled each other were soured not softened by grief and every arrangement raised discussions which did not tend to bring them nearer together
two had been only as shy as tom himself they had been reading alone and were glad to join company a third was beginning to come and it had led to a more friendly intercourse
it was interrupted when oliver after waiting in vain for more distinguished company began to marshal his guests to the grand hall paved with black and white marble and with a vast extent of wall and window decked with evergreens flags and mottoes
smithers she was a great way from all other friends for the table had been spread for a more numerous assembly and the company sat in little clusters with dreary gaps between where moulds of jelly quaked in vain and lobster salads wasted their sweetness on the desert air
one version said that mr
that one is a beautiful poet's dream
one thing may mitigate another
and is no one here whom i know
i fear there is hardly any one said mr
i'll never have one stone of it
it is because he is one of this world's heroes that he is distasteful to you
and very dismal just because no one will believe so
but it is the last which one learns
not any one who could love him so well oh no
not one of the old set george
there is only one sort of appeal to their feelings that tells
i think practical life dulls one
not even the one heartfelt greeting was without sadness and clara likewise met with one solitary satisfaction and that a very mixed one
she had married a vision of perfection and entered on a romance of happy poverty and she had no desire to awaken so she never exerted her mind upon the world around her when it seemed oppressive and kept the visionary james frost before her in company with adeline and the transformed sir hubert
such confidence makes one feel a redoubled responsibility
if anything were wanting the coincidence proves that you were cut out for one another
oh then at once and without seeing any one please
lord ormersfield said mary collecting herself only one thing
isabel had expressed a wish that mary should be one of her bridesmaids
london was under one of the fogs of which it is popularly said you may cut them with a knife
it seems to me one of the cases where the immediate duty is the more clear because it is so very painful
you shall see no one said louis tenderly you shall rest
willis was anxious to take her tired little ones home at once
i never look to see poor northwold more but it has been a place of blessings to me and you have been one of them
no one spoke after the first glance mrs
his apparent neglect after all arose from his absorption in the one object
one motive is too high for praise the other no i will say nothing of it
how unlike every one of those three of her past experience
oh for that first ball where no one danced with me but mr
for one moment james moved nearer to his uncle
i know no harm of him but if there's one man i trust less than another it is one that tries the serious dodge
the child was sitting on the nurse's lap with a hot red spot on one cheek teased and disturbed by the noises that the lesser ones were constantly making as one lay in her cot and the other was carried about by the girl
nay mary with redoubled gentleness there is one who cannot let you go without seeing him
james pressed his hand saying i am glad you are to be the one to be happy next
say that one thing to me again whispered mary ere letting his hand go
they become quite ridiculous without some one to show that such things may be carried too far
and out poured one of those torrents of fierce passion which had been slowly but surely the death of his wife
then i will only write one more letter to fitzjocelyn and tell him that your objections are insuperable and that he must think of it no more
was the cry my dear friends he said holding up his hands if you only knew how i long to have no one to speak to
i must have the pleasure of looking natural sometimes without causing any vituperation of any one beyond seas
it shall be remedied at home said oliver as if he considered mutton broth as one degree from famine
the less merit when one has learnt that they are very cold hard stones said isabel smiling
james had been thinking it meant for some one but as he said certainly not for you dear granny
my evidence could be of no service to fitzjocelyn when my uncle's maxim is to place confidence in no one
charlotte cried heartily no one else was allowed that privilege when the 13th came excepting mrs
james i'm eighty to morrow i little expect to make any more journeys except one mercy
their minds were diverted by the eager desire of one of the young officers to visit the silver mines
frost and then it was plain that something was wrong between him and his uncle and no one could believe but that his temper had been the cause
his little ones were all the world to him and he could not see how a pattern mother should ever be so happy as with them around her
mary had never heard one in the full tide before but she stood firm there were none of the tears auch as in her mother had been wont to exasperate him further but with pale cheeks compressed lips and hands locked together her heart was one silent entreaty that it might be forgiven him above
this bed being changed for one more holy this room for one more melancholy some tomb that oft hath flung its black and wing like panels fluttering back triumphant o'er the fluttering palls of her grand family funerals
i had it it was exceeding of mary had refused to let which have had her anxiously said she did not look district since she she had known have had all had gone on be said mary was so be speak from lima
he dwelt on her timid affection and simplicity and her exceeding mortification at the slur which mary had been induced to cast upon her though he said her innocent mind could not comprehend the full extent of the injury since the step his daughter had taken would when known seriously affect the lady's reception into society in a manner only to be repaired by mary's immediately joining them at lima
mansell wished to speak with her if she were ready
her heart grew sick as she counted the weeks ere she could hear from lima
said mary standing apart and speaking clearly
james at first proposed writing to her enclosing a letter to isabel but he changed his mind unable to satisfy himself that when absent from restraint she might not send a refusal without affording her daughter the option
she said she had fostered the same temper in poor jem who had it strongly enough by inheritance and that she had never known the evil nor understood it as pride till she saw the effects
she refused to wear the same dresses twice and cried stamped her graceful foot and pouted when he remonstrated
you remember her sutton and her bishop home and often she would show me some passage that had struck her as prettier than ever well as she had always known it
birds were an almost unknown race in peru and here even green things had departed scarcely a tuft of blossom looking out on the face of the red and purple rock and the exceeding stillness so awful that even the boy sailor scarce dared to speak above his breath
i will try what can be done said mary unless you would speak to mr
tom was the sound good religious man to whom her heart and her troth were given the other was no such thing a mere flatterer and she had known it all along
yet she began firmly if you please would you be so kind as to let me go to aunt melicent
pray said mary feebly don't let us discuss it now
there have i there were wanted in her and ate ten had gone with taste she was falling she miss her miss when were she halt she was wanted
mrs martha had been grimly kind to her ever since she had been afflicted with the cook for a fellow servant and received her only with a reproof for coming gadding out when she ought to be hard at work but when she heard the invitation she became wrathful she had rather go ten miles out of her way than even look at that there ford
it was a contrast to lady conway reading her letters and discussing engagements with comfortable complacency and virginia making suggestions and louisa's grave bright eyes consulting hers and miss king quietly putting in a remark and the anticipation of walter's return as if he were the only person wanting
ramsbotham had called and had been extremely insolent about a boy whose ears had been boxed for reading pickwick in school under cover of his latin grammar and isabel was almost indignant with miss faithfull for having ventured to hint to her that she wished mr
oh mary how i have wanted you
fitzjocelyn and isabel were near the window talking over her former home and her sisters and all the particulars of the society which she had left and he had entered highly interesting to themselves and to the listening clara but to the uninitiated sounding rather like taste shakspeare and the musical glasses
so the young fellow wants to be coming down does he
i have called you do her sneeze to forgive
you are not fit to protect her
and that is all you call it
you forgive me james
he had no turn for being a country gentleman he was fit for nothing but his counting house and he intended to return thither as soon as he had installed his mother at cheveleigh and so entirely did all his plans hinge upon his nephew that even now he was persuaded to hold out his forgiveness on condition that james would apologize resign the school and call himself dynevor
make him forgive me but do not let me see him yet
forgive me for having harassed you said mr
will he forgive me and let me come home
but he will believe me he will forgive me he will take me home
i forgive i am sorry for you my poor child
let me call mamma said isabel
people who call her mrs
coachman by calling on mrs
i have heard her call him my charge
it was a call to train himself in manliness and self reliance
i understand the world will call it a wise choice
i thought you would forgive me for coming to meet you under such an escort said isabel especially as it was to escape from our peruvian relative
frost's grief at it and the forgiveness from the earl and it had been the most humiliating distress of james's childhood
mrs ponsonby called it my duty to test my feelings and i have tested them
it does me good to hear poor oliver call it home
louis would call her life a mournful picture of our civilization
i suppose i must call there before the holidays though he added reluctantly
her passage had been taken and this was an argument that told on the earl though he refused to call it irrevocable
where two so called duties clash she is at perfect liberty to make her choice
she said would james still forgive her and not believe such dreadful things but trust and be patient with her and perhaps uncle oliver might after all be set on going to peru and beyond remonstrance
as thanks to my most unselfish of cousins i may dare to call you i regret my fervency and urgency for an interview since it led you to think i could purchase even such happiness by a subterfuge unworthy of my calling and an ill return of the hospitality to which we owed our first meeting
louis said an entreating voice above and there stood mary pray say nothing but call a cab for me please
clara grieved for him whenever she saw him called on to exert himself to talk and she even guarded him from the sallies of his young cousins
at that moment when louis's face was crimson with confusion and impatience the door was softly pushed ajar and he heard himself called in low hoarse tones
robson was here obliged to call madison to refer some question to him but mary had another talk with him when he begged to know if there were likely soon to be an opportunity of sending to england
james frost and none of the ladies of northwold even wished to do more than exchange morning calls with her and talk among themselves of her fine ladyism
she had no spirit to break entirely with him and even now is pining for one kind word which he seems to be too hard and selfish to send to her in answer to a letter of forgiveness that she wrote a fortnight back
he went to call on lady conway and was better satisfied to find that james had written in a lively strain to her as if proud of his little daughters and resolved not to be pitied
fitzjocelyn politely apologized to ellen for a second time stepping over her soapy deluge and as he opened the study door with a preliminary knock a voice as sharp and petulant as it was low called out hollo
the income of the school with their former well husbanded means was affluence for the style to which he aspired and his grandmother though her menus plaisirs had once doubled her present revenue regarded it as the same magnificent advance and was ready to launch into the extravagance of an additional servant and of fitting up the long disused drawing room and the dining parlour hitherto called the school room and kicked and hacked by thirty years of boys
if you are willing to reside at our family seat with my mother i will assure you of a suitable allowance during her lifetime and nothing was more intolerable to a man like james than a shower of obligations and his spirit angered at the very length of the address caught at the first opening for avoiding gratitude and beheld in the last proposal an absolute bribe to make him sacrifice his sacred ministry and he burst forth sir i am much obliged to you but no offers shall induce me to forsake the duties of my calling
she i did not understand
i could not show you his letter but from it and from my aunt i better understand what impressions he has of you all and how hopeless it is
said james as louis stood with the note in his hand as if not yet understanding the blow
if you could understand i don't want to understand nothing
he would not like me to have cause to blush before my kind friends to know that i had acted a deceit nor to set an example to my sisters for which they might not understand the justification
did it not seem with all the associations of cold of peril of dreariness to be a visible token that indeed he who fashioned it could prepare good things past man's understanding
and james if she should express any desire to see me if i can be of any use in settling matters or could promote any better understanding with your uncle i am ready at a moment's notice
oliver laughed his scornful chuckle and said he did not understand that sort of brother and sister but happily he became absorbed in showing his mother the fittings of her splendid bedroom
he had come to a comfortable understanding with old mr
why what i don't understand
i understand you but you will think differently by and by
poor old xavier often had she hunted and teased him and tried to make him understand cosas de inglalerra and to make him cease from his beloved dice but no sooner did he see her face than with a cry of joy la senorita maria
but by making the newly married pair victims of injustice the earl had made the reality a relief and melicent had written civilly to her brother and a sisterly sort of stiff letter to the bride of which the limenian could not understand one word so that mary had to render it all into spanish even to her good aunt's hopes that rosita would be kind to her and use all her influence in favour of her happiness
my glory is in the assurance that you understand my letter approve and are relieved
can't you isabel i am sure you and i shall understand each other
oh very well said james sitting down to his writing as if he had done with her i understand
i have begun to understand why there never yet has been an authentic account of a great battle said louis
but i don't understand why he let you come straight home to us and live in dynevor terrace
it was not divide
he thought he had a right to be consulted for he by no means believed himself to have abdicated his headship of the family and he made his voice heard entirely without effect except the indignation of his uncle and the absence of the conway carriage although lord ormersfield wrote that he should bring sir walter in his own person thus leaving james divided between satisfaction in any real token of respect to his grandmother and dislike to gratifying oliver's ostentation by the production of his baronet kin
no that must not be
can you not trust me
it was not for me said james
this is not cheveleigh
alas it was not to be
not so her brother
you are not ready
do not rise up in arms against me fitzjocelyn i do not accuse her
he will thank you by and by for not attending to him now that he does not know what he says
not so fast sir
you said i was not to go without meeting her
i do not wish to pry into your affairs
i would not believe mrs
well i should have liked him better if he had not given into it
why did you not find this out before
all is it not enough to set her free
that was before no i ought not
perhaps you have not heard that mr
do you not consider it an excellent appointment
but you have not removed my amazement
did i not long sorely after you when
it is not the first letter i have had from him
how could you be distressed and not let me know
his first thought was to apologize that is not all
do you not know how i would wait
not into believing her wrong
you are only saying what i would not hear from her
the growth had not been all on louis's side
ponsonby had not mentioned it as likely
yes you were to have married the visconde were you not
you are not going yet
surely he is not a beggar
welcome is not to be bought said james
you do not imagine that he wishes it
by not neglecting you all your youth
never cried isabel i should not believe it was you
i knew he was not what you all thought him
i believe it is the peace that is not of this world
that was the only thing to make me not hate it
however that was not the present consideration
ward could not be thought of at the same moment
then you have not heard from cheveleigh
it would not be easy to come down to what i have to offer
his saying them does not make them true
you have not to choose between him and your uncle
could he have spoken then what might not have followed
but he did not go to the drawing room
i did not know you were come home
you had better not stay here in the cold
ah it is not what it was said the earl
that's not the worst of it
an original axiom is not it
no isabel was not come to that
it is not acting rightly by me isabel but i would not care for that if it were acting rightly by yourself
fitzjocelyn you do not mean that you do not fully approve of the course i have taken
i thought i had found something at which you could not grumble
i rejoice that the moon does not stoop from her sphere
you need not think it dear mr
i'm not afraid said isabel smiling
yours is not a family to bring disgrace into
there's your father not had a morsel of breakfast
only whose fault soever it was it was not jem's
you her do not bear them be
beckett begged that marianne might be chosen since she could not bear to see the poor thing sent away when in so much need of care
i cannot bear it any longer
then i must stay and bear all this you think
it was a marvellous work but it might still be a question whether the profit would bear out the expense
perhaps he was the very last person she could bear to see feeling as she did that if he had been more explicit all the offence would have been spared
don't talk of it clara said louis hastily we cannot dwell on ourselves and bear it patiently
she meant well at first but the terrace cannot bear competition with a place like this
o louis it is true that there is no bearing to stay at home in those great empty rooms
she had a dull heavy sensation that she must bear all and this was the beginning and she was about to begin her arrangements for her dreary landing when mrs
at last bearing a light there came forward a faded sallow dame with a candle in her hand who might have sat for the picture of the duena rodriguez and at her appearance the negroes subsided
beckett it takes all her love for missus and master oliver to make her bear it and her chief solace is in putting me to bed and in airing master oliver's shirt and slippers
the conversation ended with some good auguries as to the effect of oliver's return to peru and louis went away cheered bearing the final dismissal better than his father had expected
she bent over the table to say you will say nothing i cannot bear to hear folded her hands and shut her eyes as if she had been going to stand fire
empty and hollow as the pageant was i could better bear to take my part in it so far as truth would let me than tell that poor man that the last of his brother's children rejects him and his benefits
so it was all to be settled over louis's passive head and thus satisfied his father who was exceedingly sorry for him forgot his anger and offered to go home alone as clara's escort promising to return on the monday to bring the full force of his remonstrances to bear down mary's scruples
to mrs frost it was pain to leave what she owned with thankful tears to have been a happy peaceful refuge for her widowhood and poverty she grieved over each parting clung to the faithfulls reiterated fond counsels to isabel and could hardly bear to detach herself from the great grandchild
she seems to think of him like a schoolboy who must be lured to find home pleasanter than idle ways and she begs me quite sadly to bear with him and make him happy to prevent him from longing after his counting house at lima
it it had fastened agent
far worse at valparaiso we met robson the confidential agent
his aunt's playful sweetness had peculiarly accorded with his disposition and the affection and confidence of his fond clinging nature had fastened themselves upon her all the more in the absence of his own mary
the head and upper part of the person were shrouded in a close hood of elastic black silk webbing fastened behind at the waist and held over the face by the hand which just allowed one be ringed finger and one glancing dark eye to appear while the other hand held a fan and a laced pocket handkerchief
for playthings or times
ponsonby and he looked on amused gratified her caprices caressed her and seemed to regard her as a pretty pet and plaything
take time to rest
5 of old times
chapter ii the third time
i see it will take some time to get up the stock of plate
happiness but he had no time to hear
pairing time anticipated cowper
at the time but think what it would be not to be able to remember happy times without remorse
go on don't waste time in stuff
ward was willing to wait as if it were only a matter of time
calcott told me once upon a time
ah snares of wealth were set far enough from me for a time
there used to be wild places sadly neglected in my time
the ladies for the first time did not sit together this morning
we will renew the discussion another time if you wish it clara said james
i thought ellen was to do such work and ought to have done it in proper time
mamma thought you would be displeased she insisted on taking her own time for breaking it to you said isabel
when she has had a little time for reflection a few cool arguments from me will bring her to reason
so mary you may have a cup of tea for me to morrow in the sala like old times
james deigned no answer looked at his watch and found it time to return to the school
when charlotte told her what was the matter her comment was and a very good thing too that you should find him out in time
i must go on the train starts at two he added hastily looking at the time piece
this is no moment for ceremony no time to deprive her of whatever she loves best
you've no business here yet and i have no time to waste on your idleness
you don't mean that kitty has been eating that heavy pudding at this time of night
no more hurrying after lost time and an uneasy remembrance of undone duties
once she said she was very thankful for the leisure time free from household cares and even from friendly gossip for she said first she had been gay then she had been busy and had never had time to meditate quietly
this might have led to a revelation if louis had had time to attend to it but he had pity on james's impatient misery and proceeded to ask the loan of the boat
i want him to feel that in beginning afresh he is doing me no injury and then in time whenever i come home it may be such a friendship as there was between our elders
willis mr ponsonby had reason to suppose you would not receive his letters in time to avail yourself of the escort
many a time had she weighed each phrase she set down so that it might offend neither against sincerity nor resignation and yet be soothing and consoling
no said isabel but formerly idle requirements thronged my time and for nothing worth doing could i find leisure
when silent time wi lightly foot had trod on thirty years i sought again my native land wi mony hopes and fears
there will be some hope of help for the curate now besides i shall know where to come for subscriptions next time i run crazy about any wonderful charity
it was the first time that clara had appeared to the earl in any light but that of an idle school girl and he said kindly it must have been very trying
then finding her efforts failing she would be distressed and melancholy until a fresh novel engrossed her for a time and the whole scene was enacted over again
impatient words broke out and isabel always received them so meekly that he repented and apologized and in the reconciliation the subject was forgotten but only to be revived another time
james took a second class ticket the first time he had ever done so in travelling with his cousin
perhaps it is a blessing vouchsafed to the true of heart to become aware of such a hidden constitutional infirmity in time to wash it out with blessed tears like those
james hovered on the outskirts of both parties too little at ease to attach himself to either fretted by his wife's interest in a world to which he was a stranger impatient of his uncle's plans and trebly angered by observing the shrewd curious glances which the old man cast from time to time towards the pair by the window
it was a time such as to be more sweet in memory than it was in the present and the shade which had hung over it the self restraint and the forbearance which it had elicited had unconsciously conduced to the development of the characters of both preparing them to endure the parting far more effectually than unmixed enjoyment could have done
louis alarmed by her looks saw that no time was to be lost and rising hastily before any one was ready perilled his fame for eloquence by rapidly assuring the gentlemen and ladies that miss dynevor was truly sensible of the kindness of their welcome and their manner of receiving the toast
we have tormented my uncle out of making us use more than two at a time by begging for six and the lord mayor's coach but aired alternately they must be and we must do it and by no road but what the coachman chooses and this does not seem to me to agree with her like trotting about the town on her errands
it was truly the loss of a most tender mother to them both bringing for the first time the sense of orphanhood on the girl left between the uncongenial though doting uncle and the irritable though affectionate brother and louis though his home was not broken up suffered scarcely less
i believe we were all too happy he presently added with a sigh which was re echoed by his father at the same time trying to say something about youthfulness to which louis who had been leaning thoughtfully on the mantelpiece presently answered how much wiser old people are than young
why that when the french were going on like robert spear and them old times he had convoyed the young lady right through the midst of them and they would both have been shot if my lady's butler hadn't come down with a revolver killed half a dozen of the mob and rescued them out of it but that lord fitzjocelyn had been desperately wounded in going back to fetch her bracelet and mr
it was well for mary that southern constellations snowy white winged albatross leaping flying fish and white capped mountain coast had been joined in her mind with something higher deeper and less personal or their recurrence would have brought her nothing but pain unmitigated in the contrast with the time when first she had beheld them six years ago
it was heart sickening to see these bickerings over the grave of one so loving and so beloved and very trying to be always on the alert to obviate the snappings that might at any time become a sharp dissension but nothing very distressing actually arose until the last day before the funeral when the three cousins were sitting together in the morning room james writing letters
andes to alps so lee so
nothing is so weak and yet so unmanageable
andes for alps no mary you need not suspect me of trifling now
it was worth going up the andes for such a sentence to put into a letter that aunt kitty would show to louis
the mountain was only one of the spurs of the andes a mere infant among the giants but had it been set down in europe mont blanc must have hid his diminished head and the view was better than on some of the more enormous neighbours which were both further inland and of such height that to gaze from them was like looking from an air balloon into vacancy
you friends now badly
you must go higher
to ask our interest for that appointment for his friend grant
lady conway has been their very best friend without intending it
on his success he went with his father to london for the session and this was all that his friends at northwold knew of him
here is an old friend oliver said his mother taking up a curious old soup ladle
subdued and anxious there had been little of the ordinary light of joy hope or gaiety and their pleasures had been less their own than in preparing the happiness of their two friends
it was almost a trance of gladness trembling in her smile and overflowing in her eye at every congratulation and squeeze of the hand from her friends
they drove through two miles of brown flat heath with far away mountain outlines which she greeted as dear friends
the discretion and reserve rendered requisite by the concealment were such as to be very tormenting even to so gentle a temper as that of louis since they took from him all the privileges openly granted to the cousin and scarcely left him those of the friend
mary was glad to have something grateful to say and answered that she should have been very sorry to lose him as a friend whereupon his face cheered up he thanked her and fell back from her rein
richardson and her friends did not esteem it a compliment when their sons were asked to meet him and on the other hand james did not always distinguish real merit from mere responsiveness to his own mind
he was far too wrathful to have any consistency or discrimination in his anger and he was cruelly wounded at finding that his sister deserted him as he thought for her uncle's riches and that his own closest friend was ready to share the spoil
never suffering herself at sea her first feelings after the final wrench of parting were interrupted by the necessity of attending to her friend a young mother with children enough to require all the services that the indefatigable mary could perform
she was fully employed nursing isabel doing honour to the little one answering oliver's letters superintending clara's wardrobe choosing parting gifts for innumerable friends high and low and making arrangements for the inexperienced household
oliver and his mother sitting close together were living in an old world asking and answering many a melancholy question on friends dead or lost sight of and yet these last they always made sure that they should find when they went home to cheveleigh that home to which the son reverted with unbroken allegiance while the whole was interspersed with accounts of his plans and explanations of his vast designs for the renovation of the old place
weeping but not unhopeful convinced though not acknowledging it inly praying for strength and patience and hungering for one kind word from james clara quitted that almost brother in whose counsel he had constrained her to seek relief and went to her own chamber there to throw herself on the guidance of that friend who sticketh closer than a brother
her louis they had placed to look
her unselfishness goes to one's heart
well said louis coolly without altering a muscle of his face as the captain looked for an angry negative
don't you look like enough to a lion looking out of a bush to frighten ten boys already said louis
three more joyous looking people could hardly have been found than those who entered the room welcoming louis with delight and asking what good wind had brought him
partly that inglewood is crying out for the master's eye said louis and partly that my father fancied i looked fagged and kindly let me run down for a holiday
when louis bade his aunt farewell he threw his arm round her neck looked fondly at her and said dear aunt you won't let them tease you
mary talked of writing a note but the autumn sun shone cheerily on the steps and louis wiled her into seating herself on the upper step while he reclined on the lower ones as they had so often been placed when this was his only way of enjoying the air
on the principle that louis must care for all that was his as he rose to take the still sleeping child upstairs he insisted that his cousin should come with him if only for the curiosity of looking at the other two little animals and learning the difference between them and kitty at whom he still looked as if her godfather had insulted her
then maybe it ain't true what's all over the place here
chapter x the wrong woman in the wrong place
fitzjocelyn placed himself beside him without remark
the captain remaining with louis with whom he was always on far more easy terms looked after the other gentleman winked again and confessed that he had suspected one or other of them might be coming that way this summer though he could not say he had expected to see them both together
and the dear old place comes back to the old name
you and i think no place equal to our birthplace said mrs
jane's place was to be not exactly supplied but occupied by a cook
the two sisters had come partly downstairs but their london habits had restrained them from following to the street door as clara had done and now they had rushed up again while clara with one foot on the staircase looked in her cousin's face as he tried to smile in answer and repeated louis i hoped you were quite happy
it might console his lordship to learn that should the union take place the whole of his property would be secured to mrs
i mean that an important change must have taken place since i understood you to say you had refused him
isabel she says dynevor terrace is the only place she ever wishes to see again
he had only reached the landing place when beneath he heard the greeting mother i can take you home cheveleigh is yours
he rubbed against the new generation in too many places for charity or gratitude to be easy
holdsworth had wonderful designs but it was not to take place until fitzjocelyn's return from cheveleigh
the palms and huge ferns had given place to pines and these were growing more scanty
mr dynevor presently explained that he intended the funeral to take place at the end of the week
ponsonby yourself he looked inquiringly at mr
the earl found mary in what had been her mother's sitting room striving to brace her resolution by recalling the conversation that had taken place there on a like occasion
i wonder at myself when i wake in the morning that i am not more moved by it nor by leaving this dear old place
above and above rose galleries whence the ore was lowered down to the buildings here placed where it underwent the first process of separation
he was the more concerned because he had thought her looking depressed and avoiding his eye
the earl replied to his exclamation of angry dismay it is little more than i looked for
any rational being would look on it as a duty to rescue her from such a man as that but that is too ordinary a virtue for you
clara looked mutely in his face with a sort of inquiring dismay
people are all surprised to see him looking so well the country lanes make him quite blooming
move to cheveleigh and look out for it at leisure if nothing else will content him
i'll come when i have heard that boy's imposition and looked over these exercises
the nurse looked down on her and the cook filled the kitchen with idlers whose looks and speeches were abhorrent to her
did i do not bring she seems her used you
why no i wished to bring her but she is but fifteen and mamma will not trust her out without herself
she used to beg me to be patient with him and rejoiced to see us together
tell louis we have a famous letter from mary to show him if he will bring us all news of every one and especially of his godchild
i hope you will not leave us as yet
just now she has us in her power and can impose conditions
louis could not bring himself to make any answer and his mother interrupted by a question as to dona rosita
come and see us
ah she said i don't feel these things as i used
i was less his choice than his father's and though i thought we should have been very happy it does not seem to be the leading of heaven
indeed what could bring him here
she did just what uncle oliver wished but only as she used to play with us no more nay rather less for her own amusement than as she would play at battledore or at thread paper verses
but now your dear uncle is bringing prosperity back i must take care not to set my heart even on what he has gained for me
she was told that these were the mules bringing down the metal in panniers the only means of communication until as the lieutenant promised a perpendicular railroad should be invented
is it not hard to reproach us with sighing at an evening immolated at the shrine of the richardsons
but he did not find that ready heed to all that occupied him of which he used to be certain at the terrace
women must keep up the tone of their own minds and she might be being useful to the world as well as to her own family
i wish i could see it as you do but not only do i know that mary could not have an instant's peace under the sense of his displeasure but it seems to me that this is one of the express commands which could not be disobeyed without setting aside the law of heaven
there was a short space of silence as the two cousins knelt in the darkened room in the sunbeams which seemed as if they could not yet forsake her who had lived in the light of love
ah jemmy you didn't know me as a county grandee she said with a bright sad look when your poor grandpapa used to dress me up
james would sometimes bring this fact more palpably before her
ejaculated the earl so he was insolent enough to bring that up was he
no but he seems to have anticipated it
but any concession seemed to affect him like an injury
each loss seemed to make the other more painful
he had designed the rupture with louis as a penalty to drive her into his measures but he could not so propound it and was wondering how to bring it in when mary relieved him by beginning herself and stating the grounds with such sensible unselfish almost motherly care of louis's happiness that he was more unwilling than ever to let him resign her and was on the point of begging her to re consider and let louis wait for ever rather than lose her
her noble aspect and demeanour so full of dignity and feeling obtained a fresh and more genuine acclamation but throughout there was a strange sense of unreality she seemed like one performing a part to gratify her son
i trust to bring myself to remember rightly and wisely
i wonder whether they would come and stay with us
i do why did he come home to bother us
i remember what i used to think of patronage
heaven knows what is to become of us
it has been mother and son between us
he have detected through he arrive she had sneezed their riverdale talked sister
he had better turn his thoughts elsewhere while he is young enough to begin again
ward and had some talk which she might have enjoyed but for her suspense
how can you talk so
the sisters always resented their mother's habit of talking of poor isabel regarding her as the happiest of women and they were confirmed in their belief by seeing her looking exceedingly well and handsome with perhaps a little more dignity and a sweeter smile
we talked it over but she heeded no ways and means it was enough that you were satisfied
my dear father if clara and i were always sister and brother when she was poor we certainly shall be no more now
as soon as this intelligence arrived mrs
my aunt was rather grand about a grammar school she said even a curacy would sound better and she must talk it over with isabel
she was urgent however that isabel should come as soon as possible since louisa had been more unwell than usual and was pining for her eldest sister and she hoped that james would join her there as soon as the holidays should set him free
don't talk of it now
it is only foolish talk
you know you are to persuade your sister
your most affectionate sister clara
i would come at once but that many might be burdensome to your uncle and sister
said james she thinks it very hard to have two sisters so little younger than herself and he peeped under the plaid at the little brown head and drew it closer round with a look of almost melancholy tenderness guarding carefully against touching her with his cold hands
frost arrived to congratulate and be congratulated she found mary still on the step gazing on without seeing the trees and flowers listening without attending to the rich soothing flow of lope de vega's beautiful devotional sonnets in majestic spanish in louis's low sweet voice
there and as if he had the sole right to her he arranged the cushions placed her on the sofa and hung over her to chafe her hands and bathe her forehead with eau de cologne while as he detected signs of hasty preparations about the room he added don't trouble yourself with your arrangements i will see about all i can to help you
are you talking madness mary
here they come and i'm talking dreadful treason
oh my dear don't talk of it now
we read and we talk and mr
good melicent were ever two sisters in law more unlike
i wish nothing better for them than to be such another pair of faithful sisters
james said louis very low but so as to make them both start that is not the way to treat your sister
i am only sorry this is nothing but mutton broth but that's what comes of sudden arrivals oliver
thus he protested against unnecessary fires isabel shivered and wore shawls he was hurt at seeming to misuse her resigned his study fire and still found the coals ever requiring to be renewed insisted that his wife should speak to the cook and mystified her by talking about the regulation of the draught of the kitchen fire and when isabel understood she forgot the lecture
ponsonby should be induced to relent by his daughter's representations on her arrival mary and louis must consider themselves as mutually released
ward shaking hands with her as if he would thereby compensate for all that was wanting in her welcome promised to go and inform her father of her arrival
his aunt however in the midst of her own joy marked his restless eye and put the question whether mary ponsonby had arrived
the weary banquet had arrived at ices and clara hoped the end was near when the worse trial of speeches began
lord ormersfield and walter arrived in the evening and james applied himself to finding occupation for his brother in law whom he kept out of the way in the garden very satisfactorily
my dear you may mean very rightly i am sure you do but you must not set people talking
i don't say that i see my way through this business but we'll talk it over together and settle matters without my lady
the boys disobeyed knowing that they should be favoured at home and if they were punished the parents talked of complaints to the trustees
mansell would prefer being left to themselves he had a repugnance to an immediate discussion with the one aunt and was in haste to carry the tidings to the other and besides it was becoming possible that letters might arrive from the travellers
as to the two young sisters their ecstasy was beyond description only alloyed by the grief of losing isabel and this greatly mitigated by schemes of visits to northwold
it was a charming account of her expedition to the hebrides written out for her sisters without a notion of anything further but jem sent it to this magazine and it is accepted and the first part is out
ward haunted the house and was most kindly forbearing and patient and mary found at every turn how good a man he was and how cruel and mistaken his sister thought her
mackay mary's letter arrived not long after louis's return to london and her calm serious beautifully expressed farewell came upon him at last like a blow which had been long impending but of which preparation had failed to lessen the weight
next arrived an exceedingly smart french milliner who by the help of jane and marianne got clara into her toils and pinned and measured her for a whole mortal morning and even grandmamma ordered a black velvet gown and accompaniments
i am now ready to make it over to my mother with entail to yourself and your heirs as representatives of my brother henry and settling five thousand pounds on your sister as the portion to which the younger children of our family have always been entitled
thereupon came down addressed to clara a case of peruvian jewels newly set in london intended doubtless to excite great jealousy in her sister in law
of this he was in no danger from his sisters in law who looked upon twin girls as the only blessing needed to complete isabel's felicity had devised three dozen names for them and longed to be invited to northwold to see them
james said louis rising indignation rendering his voice more low and clearly distinct than ever i little thought to hear you insult that orphan sister of yours in her grief
i declare fitzjocelyn exclaimed his father with some anger any one who takes the trouble may talk you into anything imaginable
he had the satisfaction of talking for a good hour about mary and of sending a message that he did not write because he wished to be guided by her in everything and that he was striving to work so as to please her
he walked about with ears of wheat in his hand talked knowingly of loads and acres and had almost taught his father to watch the barometer
i shall protest it is not graceful to make an uproar about your own magnanimity nor to talk of what is to happen after a man's death
they talked of mary and a little of james from whom clara had once heard but it had been a stiff letter as if a barrier were between them and then mr
louis talked vigorously of virginia and louisa secretly marvelling how his hosts had brought themselves down to such fare
frost would take the consequences mounted the british lion and i bowed him out upon that majestic quadruped talking grandly of illiberal prejudices and the rising generation
when the married pair took leave walter gave his sister a great hug but had no perception of his office of handing her downstairs and it was fitzjocelyn who gave her his arm and put her into the carriage with an augury that the weather would be beautiful when once they had left the fog in london
the breakfast was by lamp light and the mist looked lurid and grim over the white cake and no one talked of anything but the comparative density of fogs and mr
talking earnestly the trio had reached the terrace and james was unlatching the iron gate when he interrupted himself in the midst of detailing his views on modern languages to say no i have nothing for you
he spoke of isabel's expensive habits and the danger of her finding it difficult to adapt herself to a small income and though of course he might as well have talked to the wind as to either of the lovers his remonstrance was so evidently conscientious as not to be in the least offensive and mr
in this strain he chose to talk without coming to particulars till near the corner of the old square they met the shouting throng of boys and presently james himself descending the steps of the grim old grey building
oliver would not be persuaded that fitzjocelyn would not meet them abroad and began magniloquently talking of his courier and his route and while he was looking for the map the two cousins smiled and clara said lucky you to have work at home and to stay with it
said adams'she found her were ragged to deserve which it
his own feelings are his best passport and well has she deserved all that he can ever feel
i found isabel alone
ah you have found me out cried rosita
the evening air was almost chill and the clearness such that they already saw the ragged height whither they were bound rising in craggy shattered grandeur every flat space or gentler declivity covered with sheds and huts for the work people and cavernous mouths opening on the cliff side
he found her pale and sorrowful but calm collected and ready for exertion
hurrying on to the drawing room he found isabel eagerly writing
he found her sense of duty more stubborn than he had anticipated and soon had no more to say
papa said mary again rallying her firmness we have found sadly how easy it is to be deceived when one is not on the spot
it was your uncle whom i robbed he would otherwise have come home like a good genius but he found you all happy without him and with no gratitude to spare for him
he found clara alone looking as if her grief were still very fresh and though striving to speak gaily the tears very near the surface
when he came to take up his credentials he found james and his little black leathern bag determined to come at least to ebbscreek with him and declaring it made him frantic to stay at home and leave his cause in other hands and that he could not exist anywhere but close to the scene of action
so between him and tom madison she was dragged up a steep path and conducted into a gallery cut out in the living rock growing gloomier and gloomier till suddenly there was a spot of light on the sparkling floor and mary found herself beneath an opening through the mountain crown right up into the sky which through the wild opening looked of the deepest most ultra marine almost purple blue utterly beyond conception in the glory of intense colour bringing only to her mind those most expressive yet most inexpressive words the body of heaven in his clearness
she is done weak you mine lamenting
happily that is done said louis not yet disconcerted but if you go as i own you must it shall be with a letter of mine explaining all
he lamented the precipitation but seemed willing to make excuses
if i must choose between him and my uncle he must be mine mine
he thinks that the the object was weak and unworthy and that my feelings could be easily overcome
ay left him up at the mines
ah but you could have done penance
should have waited done it in style
it is all i ever thought you would receive and but for me it would have been in the bottom of some mine long ago
he is free now and he will soon find a rosita if his mines are not sufficient for him
but lord ormersfield had done rosita and her husband good service
this done mary faced her life in the new world
can't get business done but by a wide awake chap like that
i hope that since it has been given back to us we may feel it more as a stewardship than i did when it was mine
charlotte and marianne had begun to merge their rivalry in honest friendship cemented by marianne's increasing weakness and difficulty in getting through even the light work her mistress required
he had been informed by undoubted authority that lord fitzjocelyn had done his daughter the honour of soliciting her hand
mr delaford waited but ellen only ran in for one moment to fetch the kettle and martha discoursed as usual on the gold mines in peru
in short isabel my dear what can you have done to set people saying that you have been corresponding with the young men at ebbscreek
oh james i can sometimes hardly contain myself that my poor boy has done it and all for me and his brother's children
the negro cook had done his best mary made her father's coffee and rosita was waited on to her satisfaction
with such sanction and with ardour before you like mine i see that you could do no other than consent and there is not a shadow of censure in my mind but if without compromising your sense of obedience you could openly avow our engagement to mr
if choice had been mine i should hardly have been exactly what i am and you know how my chief happiness has been put far from me but i can imagine that to be at the summit of my wishes might foster my sluggishness and that i might rest too much on better judgment than my own if it were beside me
do you know i think mine is the little spar of love that he tries to cling to in the great ship wreck and i feel quite sorry and hypocritical that it is such a poor miserable shred
he smiled saying that his nearest neighbours were many miles off an engineer conducting some far more extensive mining operations whom he sometimes met on business and an old spanish gentleman who lived in a valley far down the mountain side with whom he sometimes smoked his cigar on a sunday if he felt inclined for a perpendicular promenade on a peruvian causeway for nearly four miles
did she ever desire you to remain here
i feel as much bound as if she had
she ended with a sound of misery
feeling rebels they mary
mary asked whether he often did feel inclined
as to my feeling for her a particle a shred of what i do for mary it was a mere fiction a romance an impossibility
isabel is very fond of northwold said mary feeling that louis was wanting her sympathy
he does not know he assured me that all was at an end it is said mary but i am certain that i shall never feel for any one else the same as and the tears were coming last
the fresh discomfiture made poor louis feel utterly dejected and almost hopeless but lest silence should seem to consent he said when you see mary you will be willing for me to do anything rather than lose what is so dear and so noble
the gentleman was affronted and resolved to make her feel it
whereas here mary had but to turn her head as her mule steadily crept round the causeway a legacy of the incas to behold the expanse of the pacific a sheet of glittering light in the sunshine the horizon line raised so high that the first moment it gave her a sense of there being something wrong with her eye before the feeling of infinity rushed upon her
mary's feelings were too deep too much concentrated for trembling
it is odd how little i feel these things said his aunt
mansell i own that i should feel that we were not drawn into a compromise of sincerity
asked louis feeling as if he had been apprenticing the boy to a chief of banditti
she shows excellent feeling and does credit to her education
say no more clara i feel no anger
and on the other hand it would be very unwholesome to be left to my own inertness to be as good for nothing as i feel
it was mary ponsonby
mary had fled what is it
then mary had heard from him
yes i will see mary
that loophole forlorn most forlorn hope as they knew it to be was an infinite solace to the young people by sparing them a formal parting and permitting them still to feel that they belonged to each other
mary to have you back again
he came back and spoke no mary
a tear burst out as mary said mamma said it must never be that way
mary you must sit down
mary i cannot hear you say so
mary shook her head
what is to become of mary with such a man as that
none whatever said mary emphatically
then you do mean to recollect mary
there is the forbidden subject said mary firmly
i did so however said mary coldly
very well said mary with steady submission
but mary drew back
mary would hear no more comments
dynevor believed that the marriage had been hastened by her relations making her feel herself unwelcome and her own reluctance to return to her convent and that she might not be aware how very recently mr
he saved himself from saying to such a man but the shrewd suspicious old bachelor was not an inviting confidant for the vicissitudes of delicate and tender feelings of such recent date and mrs
it was a melancholy certainty that mary must go to mrs
my poor mary that is what comes of doing what i like instead of what you like
ward handed out mary and inquired for mr
said mary i applied to him before i could venture to join this party
ward said mary gravely though much touched
never mind said mary smiling though her eyes overflowed i must be glad to be at home again and such a welcome as this o mary mary
it mattered the less since isabel must receive james's note early in the morning and so in fact she did and she was blushing over it and feeling as if she could never have borne to meet his eye but for the part she had fortunately taken when louisa tapped at her door with a message that mr
no one could feel anything but admiring astonishment at the fantastic craggy height of peaks and spires rising against the darkening sky like the very stronghold of the giant of the western star and with the black openings of the galleries here and there showing the lights of the workmen within
louis she she were gone there were yesterday
she had been over fatigued yesterday and had followed her advice in going to lie down
how could you go through yesterday
yesterday was a terrible strain on her
far she we ought be had with apples
you would wait said poor mary striving with choking tears and be sorry you had waited
her even temper was for once ruffled and her bosom swelled at the thought that his reproach was unjust she was willing to do what was fitting and he ought not to expect her to be an absolute nursery maid
and oh how well expressed how entirely what it ought to be
i ought to have heard sooner
i never ought to have listened to you said charlotte
i say louis ought i to go down
clara came up to him saying i believe i ought to do what he may wish
she became deadly white and sat bolt upright stiff and motionless barely stifling a scream and her eyes fixed between command and entreaty on her cousin without seeing far less acknowledging the bows levelled at her
no no he knows how far to go with me
i have pity on my aunt i have far more pity on your uncle
oliver will have far more to dispose of than the five thousand pounds guaranteed to her
he said all that the rest of the world ought to have felt and so heartily and sincerely as to make every one imagine the whole the general sentiment and the welcoming hurrah was cordial and joyous
now james brought up on a very different scale knew in detail how the household ought to live and made it a duty not to exceed a fixed sum
i must write an apology as far as her character is concerned but be that as it may the marriage is atrocious an insult a disgrace
of those to whom louis's concerns had been as their own one had been taken from him the other two were far away and the cold yes very good fell coldly on his ear
if such repugnance to him were felt even by louis the least personally affected and the best able to sympathize with his aunt it was far stronger in james abhorring patronage sensible that happen what might his present perfect felicity must be disturbed and devoid of any sentiment for cheveleigh that could make the restoration compensate for the obligation so unpleasantly enforced and isabel's fastidious taste made her willing to hold aloof as far as might be without vexing the old lady
and now all fond illusions as to her father had been snatched away her very love for him rendering the perception doubly cruel her mother her precious mother far away in ormersfield churchyard her life probably shortened by his harshness her place occupied by a young girl differing in language in church in everything mary's own pardon uncertain after all her aacrifices a sense of having deeply offended hung upon her and her heart was so entirely in england that had her home been perfect her voyage must still have been a cruel effort
madonna mary little then i did i do not last
i fear i did him great injustice
as they drove through the dark streets mary heard a little restless movement betraying some embarrassment and at last with an evident desire of reassuring her he said senora rosita is thought very pleasing and engaging and then as if willing to change the subject he hastily added i suppose you did not speak the pizarro
he blundered on a little longer becoming more confused and distressed every minute and at last came to the point abruptly
this afforded mary an opportunity for getting rid of him at last by sending him to make arrangements for her baggage to be sent from callao the next morning
i told you that dear grandmamma had a cold and so we would not let her come to isabel but i little guessed what was coming
after a little spanish conversation all kind on his aide and thus infinitely relieving mary they parted for the night
she on whose arm he had leant all last summer would not now walk with him without an escort and even with mrs
what louis did not see was that the very force of her own affection was what alarmed mary and caused her reserve
yet mary was not so much absorbed and satisfied with the visible and practical as had once been the case
we came at eleven last night
to look at her son wait on him and hear his voice so fully satisfied her that as yet it made little difference what that voice said and it never entered her mind to suppose that all her dear ones were not sharing her bliss
and louis have you read the last western magazine
my last home with brimming eyes mrs
at last oliver came up to her saying here ma'am mr
i thought his ardour was too hot to last long
tho this was fair and that was braw and you the toast of all the town i sighed and said amang them a ye are not mary morison
oh no thank you no said mary decidedly though very low i told lady conway that i could not stay
but still it was her own son and her own home and oliver and cheveleigh were more to her than even james and dynevor terrace so that though she was sorry it was not with a melancholy sorrow and she could still hope against hope that uncle and nephew might be brought together at last and that a son of james would yet reign in the dear old place
i have read very little for sport lately
you were a little bit of a schoolboy
golding after a little confusion mr
she smiled a little
would you do you do she did not say
but i fancy though he will not say so that mr
why could you not say so instead of all that humbug
james you should not say wrong things said clara
after all the connexion with that fellow ponsonby might have been very troublesome and it is well as she says that it was all over while you are so young
what this costs me i will not say it will be bare existence till we meet at scarborough
no she concluded he says that you are the last person whom he could think of allowing me to accept
whether rosita would have comprehended this without mary's blushes might be questioned but she did say ah
james could scarcely find it in his heart to say a single word to damp her joy and all his resolution enabled him to do was to say gently you know dear granny we must not forget that i am a clergyman
depend upon it there is a greatness in him which may show when as dear granny says she has cured him of all he learnt away from home
when at length he spoke again it was to say that he begged that she would forget what was past and allow him to continue on his former footing
jane says he tried flirting with poor little charlotte and that she was a little took up with his guitar and his verses but then jane says charlotte has somewhat at the bottom and knows better than to heed a man as wasn't real religious
at ebbscreek did you say
do you wish to see what he says
we will say no more about it now
you may say so
ward perfectly agreed and then he began to say something rather long and a little disconnected and mary's mind took an excursion to aunt kitty and the reading of the letter that she was going to write when suddenly something in mr
let me go i say
but alas how much more the heart had now to say
whom did you say he was going to marry
besides my aunt says that he and mr
i know what i am saying
well i may say very well allowing for inexperience
i dare say said james
james was obliged to say thank you
one you had convinced
if disappointed one day he was equally eager the next he submitted obediently to her restrictions and was remorseful when he forgot or transgressed and they had real soothing comforting talks just often enough to be tantalizing and yet to convince him that all the other unsatisfactory meetings and partings were either his own fault or that of some untoward circumstance
ponsonby i am convinced he has too much regard for his daughter to summon her into any improper society
i would have trusted you anywhere but when it comes round to me that you have been sending a private messenger to one of the young gentlemen there i don't know what to be at
how much it felt as if the only shelter or rest in the desolate world was in the light of the blue eyes whose tender sunshine had been on her for one instant
his father shook his head and looking from one to the other of the young people congratulated himself that here at least there were no perils of that description
with the interest of her fortune he meant to insure his life that as he told louis with gratified prudence there might be no repetition of his own case and his family might never be a burden on any one
it changed him from the unstable reed he once had been and helped him to take one steady and consistent view of the trial required of him and of mary and then to act upon it resolutely and submissively
there was one gratification for mary at least in the pleasure this would afford at home but robson continued making conversation about mr
who i have read in all
from all i have heard of mr
let me read them to you
that she is why with her i really do like reading and drawing all the morning
ah said the earl when the chief part had been read to him she is admirable and excellent as ever
mary stood by it reading the names and trying to perceive louis's principle of selection in each case
she read and dreamt created leisure for reading lived in a trance and awoke from it to see her work neglected reproach herself and strain her powers to make up for what was left undone
manaell making an unwilling sound between his teeth took it from her but as he read his countenance changed and he exclaimed ha
mary suspected that he regarded it as something conclusive and took care to read it when there were no eyes to mark her emotions
it was agreed on all hands that nature had formed her for a lady's maid and a few lessons from a hairdresser would make her perfection and she would be invaluable in reading to louisa when restless and unable to sleep
cheveleigh was treated in the domestic circle with judicious silence oliver's letters were read by his mother in private and their contents communicated to jane alone whose happiness was surpassing and her contempt for dynevor terrace quite provoking to poor mrs
nurse entertained mr delaford below stairs and in pity to so grand a gentleman constrained to mix with such low servants the nurse had yielded and charlotte sat safe and sound by the nursery fire smiling at his discomfiture and reading over tom's letters with an easier conscience than for many a day
i did not say 1864 unfortunately it have convinced
you are aware that when unfortunate circumstances involved my mother's property it was my determination to restore the inheritance to her and to my dear brother henry
the estminster invitation was already on the road but unfortunately lady conway had been unable to secure lodgings large enough to receive the children
unfortunately louis felt that to own oliver's generosity it was necessary to be out of sight of him and finding that there was silence and constraint in the drawing room he asked isabel to walk with him to meet james
he says he should have brought you home all the same began louis
this was not what miss ponsonby had intended to say but there was something about the young man that touched her exceedingly even when fresh from a very civil and decorous combat with his father and a ripping up of all the ancient grievances of the married life of their two relations rendering wider than ever the breach between the houses of ponsonby and fitzjocelyn
lord ormersfield took james in hand undertaking to make him hear common sense but the sense was unfortunately too common and the authoritative manner was irritating above all when a stately warning was given that no church preferment was to be expected from his influence whereupon james considered himself insulted and they parted very stiff and grand the earl afterwards pronouncing that nothing was so wrongheaded as a conscientious man
i dare say you know best said louis lazily
only i say clara when you break down anywhere send me a telegraph
i won't say but i thought there might be some grain of truth at the bottom and you shall hear it by and by when i know what it is myself
i must say i did expect strength of mind and common sense for your own interest
his aunt followed him to the stairs and he turned to her saying anxiously no letter
ward say that is a very fine intelligent young fellow worthy of his library
he says their pride and narrow notions poisoned yes that is the word poisoned her mind against him and that was the reason he insisted on my being brought up here and kept from you all
them had move in what was falling from
you would find you had waited for what was nothing worth
salome is hard to move
sir roland had disappeared and james and sir hubert were falling farther and farther asunder
without moving he held it out purple and chilled exclaiming ha
one step he made to find the earl but too much excited to move away or to atand still he came towards her wrung her hand in a more real way than in his first bewildered surprise and exclaimed in transport o mary
it was in the grand saloon where the closed shutters availed not to exclude the solid beams of slanting sunlight falling through the crevices and glancing on the gilding velvet and blazonry upon the costly coffin that shut her out from the dear tender hands and lips that had never failed to caress away her childish griefs
she shrank from the contemplation took her letter case on her knee moved close to the fire to profit by the light stirred up a clear flame and proceeded with the benevolent hermit who came to the rescue when sir hubert was at the last gasp and adeline had received his beautiful resigned words
how could pretty there have care she did her do she do you ought be my dearest candy
james's she would never have imagined that she had any concern with such splendour but her grandmother asked him if the carriage were there as a mere matter of course and jane devolved on him all luggage cares as coolly as if she had been ruling over him all his life
we had letters this morning dearest
some would have thought her letter stiff and laboured but she had learned to believe that a grave and careful style befitted a serious occasion and would have thought incoherency childish or affected
she had only a few scruples or rather she knew that james would have some as to exposing charlotte to delaford's attentions after what she had heard in clara's letter but the least hint on this score led to a panegyric upon delaford's perfections his steadiness his prudence his cleverness on journeys his usefulness in taking care of walter
ward his brow unfurrowed from counting house cares walked beside mary's mule gathered each new flower for her and listened to her narrative of some of the causes for which she was glad with her own eyes to see tom madison in his scene of action
no no don't he said i will not harass you with my gladness dearest
it will be a very pretty new style of wedding tour
cried louis wounded when you know that to cherish and make up to you would be my dearest fondest wish
that's what i care most about
clara come take care
then your ankle must be pretty well was mary's first contribution to the conversation
that luminous sea sparkling like floods of stars had been little more than how pretty
she owned it most reluctantly but oh
he walked backwards she forwards
1851 dearest jem i can write a long letter to night for a fortunate cold has spared me from one of sir andrew's dinner parties
she trusts you completely and whatever you think sufficient she regards as ample
she cannot have it transpire while she is in their house and in fact is excessively afraid of mr
little day she mind use crying use stop they
james was trying to persuade louis to rouse himself to be revived by bread and cheese and beer and could extort nothing but a drowsy repetition of the rhyme in old days the war cry of the grammar school against the present headmaster the welshman had liked to be choked by a mouse but he pulled him out by the tail when an alarum came in the shape of a little grinning boy from beauchastel with a note on which james had nearly laid hands as he saw the writing though the address was to the viscount fitzjocelyn
exclaimed james stopping oh
you crying out for silence
was still her vehement cry
weary as she was mary heard again and again through her unglazed windows the watchman's musical cry of ave maria purisima las es temblado
henderson if clara could have driven james from her mind she would have been delighted but there could be no triumph for her where he was excluded
little george as she took him by both hands who would have thought it
but to her the words were drowned in her own breathless cry my boy
she and clara would betake themselves to their present little sitting room and make the drawing room pleasant and beautiful for the bride
still she hurried on till they came out on a quiet little garden where the tinkling of a little fountain was the only sound the water looked clear and fresh with the gold fish darting in it and the sun shone calmly on the bright flowers and wavy ferns adorning the rockwork
i am of his mind said mrs
ha never mind clara
his eyes were perhaps a greater support to her than even conversation for she gathered a little philosophy and charity from their cheering smile and arch twinkling and she managed to listen civilly to her neighbour while she saw that her cousin was being very polite to mrs
he even went the length of coming up to family prayers in hopes of there meeting charlotte but she only joined the procession at the parlour door and had flown upstairs like a little bird before he was out again
i told him you were the best dissipation and virginia was of the same mind
then pushing back his chair with never mind to mrs
never mind that manage better now ha clara
gaily dressed people surrounded the entrance and amid triumphant strains from the band the carriage stopped and oliver held out his hand saying welcome home mother
spring was on the borders of summer when one afternoon as clara sat writing a note in the drawing room she heard a tap at the door of the little sitting room and springing to open it she beheld a welcome sight
so you did not have to tell neither she do not know
i would not have thought it of you isabel nor of the lad neither
dear james o tell me you are not angry with me
i know he wishes i were not in holy orders
i know i have been telling your uncle so but we can do something
why did you not tell them i never will sit down said louis gently
if he could not enter the ravine without thankfulness for his past escape neither could he forget gratitude to her who had come to his relief from hopeless agony
this way you would have neither
he begged his grandmother to write to isabel but she thought her letter might carry too much weight and whatever might be her hopes it was not for her to tell the young lady that such means were sufficient
there i know you are a reasonable girl that can be silent and not go on teasing
he had been so long absent that he did not know how much these things had been disused
but louis suddenly exclaimed the earl did you not tell me something extraordinary about james frost
i do not know what my uncle may propose said james but i know you coincide in my determination that he shall never interfere with the duties of my office
mamma does not allow for the force of imagination said isabel not exactly knowing what prompted either the words or the sigh
mansell's kindness to tell him herself before leaving beauchastel but lady conway entreated her not to be hasty and protested that her fears were of mr
poor oliver could he but have known that isabel only glanced at them to tell clara the names of the ornaments and to relieve her mind by assurances that the whole of a set need not be worn at once
then i must tell you
much did they enjoy the prediction that james would not know his own house greatly did they delight in sowing surprises and in obtaining aunt catharine's never failing start of well pleased astonishment
i told him that neither mr
they her was state man apple she 1864
but her resolution was fixed
but what did that man ramsbotham want with you
and charlotte was in rather an excited state at the presence of a peruvian production and the flutter of expecting a letter which would make her repent of the smiles and blushes she had expended over an elaborate valentine admired as an original production and valued the more alas
the wretched man but oh
was there ever a more intolerable man
maybe so but i have my doubts whether you are the man to make it
eight men and a french man cook
he is the noblest most generous most disinterested man i ever knew
her mother would not have thought me man enough and that is what i have to work for
poor man he has a poor welcome among you said louis
you and he would not combine to cheat the old man like a pair of lovers in a trumpery novel
it was the letter of a very angry man too violent to retain the cold formality which he tried to assume
the man is my enemy and has sown dissension in my family from the first moment i connected myself with him
but oliver said his mother i thought this robson was an honest man in whom you had entire confidence
ha ha d'ye think i'd put that in _any_ man
mr oliver is but a poor little puny man and i never knew mr
delaford with his whiskers freshly curled and his boots in a state of fascinating polish walked up dynevor terrace the door was opened by ellen and the red faced cook and the upright mrs
the green twilight and chequered shade well accorded with the state of their minds darkened indeed by one of the severest losses that could ever befall either of them and yet it was a sorrow full of thankfulness and blessed hope
nothing was too much for him to lavish on his mother and he was profuse in orders for hangings velvet blazonry mutes and hired mourners greedy of offers of the dreary state of empty carriages demanding that of lord ormersfield and wanting james to write to lady conway for the same purpose
i beg your pardon my dear he may be a very good man but what becomes of all this scrambling over barricades with the young lord
you'll get over it my girl and we'll find some honest man worth two of your niggardly proud spirited earls
he came down on dynevor terrace as a consequential moneyed man contemptuous of the poverty which he might have alleviated and obtruding tardy and oppressive patronage
ah isabel as he looked at her beautiful countenance how i pity the man who has not a high minded wife
you would like to see me loitering about pensioned to swell the vanity of cheveleigh neglecting my vows forsaking my duties you unreasonable man
at cheveleigh we'll have a solemn steady butler with no nonsense nor verses nor guitars forty years old and a married man
i don't understand exclusive devotion to one object grand though it was has made him the man he appears to us
i think he is overtasking himself at the school and three children within a year may well make a man anxious and oppressed
charlotte drove him on with the box till they were close to the fly and then leaving him and the man to adjust the packing flew back to announce that all was ready for her mistress
he was a little spare shrivelled man drolly like his nephew but with all the youthfulness dried out of him the freckles multiplied by scores and the keen black eyes sunken sharpened and surrounded with innumerable shrewd puckers
oliver levelled his keen eyes on him as though noting down observations while he was burning for tidings of mary yet held back by reserve and sense of the uncongeniality of the man
was the quick reply from a withered small but not ill dressed old man i only asked let the lady pass said james peremptorily wishing to save his wife from annoyance it is of no use i never look at petitions
here is a man who started with a grand heroic purpose to redeem the estate not for himself but for her and his brother he exiles himself he perseveres till this one pursuit for which he denies himself home kindred wife or child absorbs and withers him up
then after a few minutes conversation of this kind something of the old conscious abruptness of tone seemed to come over the young man and looking down he said bluntly miss ponsonby do you think there would be any objection to my coming into lima just for christmas
transgress your grandmother's wishes condemn that poor man to a desolate objectless covetous old age make the breach irreconcilable for ever and will james be the better or the happier for your allowing his evil temper the full swing
i yes i so
yes i will i never came here for this
yes i walked here this morning
yes let it wait
did i yes i see it now i am with aunt melicent
yes he did knew that i was to supplant him
yes i pity her for being exposed to his parading
yes indeed i am
my uncle yes what shall i do with my uncle
yes said james we don't like family names
oh yes go i shall be able to speak to you when you come back
yes said isabel the sense of leisure and tranquillity here is marvellous
yes but how shameful to wish james to forget his ordination
yes my dear i must go to poor little clara
oh yes if you wish it he answered gruffly as if vexed at her gratification
yes said isabel little catharine is obedience itself with us
yes you do for all the sportsmen will be coming home and my aunt would not for all the world that mr
oh yes if you like said isabel never raising her eyes from the rebuilding of the ruined chapel in the valley
yes we all knew it was a threat of your uncle but we spared you the knowledge thinking that all might yet be accommodated and never expecting it would come on you in this sudden way
hidden said clara yes indeed it was even from herself because it never showed in manner like my pride she was gracious and affable to all the world
yes i see he continued as clara signed heavily but you don't know the good it will do you to have your mind forcibly turned aside
and ye shall walk in silk attire and siller hae to spare gin ye'll consent to be his bride nor think of donald mair
she have fixed she had placed to send
frost but the earl deferred the moment by sending the carriage with an entreaty that she would come herself to fetch her guest
she justifies her brother in everything and is actually working on that poor girl's scruples of conscience to send her out by this ship
he had some fossils which he wished to send to lord fitzjocelyn and he fetched them and explained his theories with regard to them as if he had almost forgotten that she was not his young lord
we will send you said lord ormersfield
we want you all the more because my uncle will not let me send for mr
she nearly avowed that she set her brother on making this premature prohibition
she attempted no words she clasped her hands over her face and ran out of the room
she had never told the mansells of the matter and they must be prepared
and still more did she question her conduct towards her father
day she am green it have been little
lie down and rest i am sure you have been awake all night
chapter iii mists therefore thine eye through mist of many days shines bright and beauty like a lingering rose sits on thy cheek and in thy laughter plays while wintry frosts have fallen on thy foes and like a vale that breathes the western sky thy heart is green though summer is gone by
they are the people to think it a mockery to be visited by a lady bedizened as i am and stuck up in a carriage so we can do very little except through mr
the region was in general more stern than beautiful the clefts between the hills looking so deep that it seemed as if an overthrown mountain could hardly fill them but now and then came sudden peeps of that wonderful ocean or almost under her feet as if she could throw a stone into it there would lie an intensely green valley shut in with feathering pines and the hacienda and grazing llamas dwindled so that they could have been taken for a swiss farm and flocks of sheep
the boat was rocking on the green waves and louis was in the act of waving an adieu to deaf mrs
clara hastily started up as her uncle and lady britton appeared in the green alley
i am much obliged
i am so happy
there was a large glass door standing open under the gothic window and through it he led her out upon a wide green lawn
louis gave her his arm pursued the path in the opposite direction and emerged at the lower end of the bowling green with the battlemented front of the house rising before them
not a green plant nor a voice to answer unless one got to the mountain echoes and they are worse but surely you have the cornishmen
i am sure mamma would
i am coming with you said the earl
i am faithful cried charlotte
does he think i am the sheriff's lady still
i am very sorry for it mr
i am particularly anxious to finish this
her did not state her have grieved her was made she was not be happy me was called
mind dynevor terrace is still your home if you do not find the happiness you expect in your chosen lot
dear james nothing would make me so happy as to go to dear home but i do not think grandmamma would like me to leave uncle oliver
james did not consciously make any difference in his manner meaning to be still affectionate though disappointed and pitying her mistake both as to her present happiness and future good
clara being still under age had it not in her power to resign her half of her grandmother's income even if her brother would have accepted it and 70 pounds made a difference in such an income as james's more especially as his innovations did not tend to fill the school
nay louis there were belonged name
let me come nay if you will not at least let clara go with you and come back
nay said the earl it is an age at which we could hardly hope she would long be spared
witness st ronan's well where the younger scrogie abjures the name of mowbray
sydney calcott wrote to him in the name of various former scholars of mrs
mr danvers the young curate whom oliver had not thought worth presenting was hailed by fitzjocelyn as if their slight oxford acquaintance had been an intimacy and was by him introduced to clara as belonging to james's college
we shall be delighted said isabel with alacrity relieved at avoiding a tete it tete with her husband at present and refreshed by the sight of one belonging to her former life and external to her present round of monotonous detail
that was the real secret source of all her discomfort namely the misgiving lest she had been too ready to follow the dictates of her own heart
property had changed hands rapidly in a region of trade and manufacture and the old dynevor name had been forgotten past recall amid the very population who were thriving upon the identical speculations which had swamped mr
i am more afraid of the difference it may make to her said louis
too late for that certainly said louis and the smile was a relief to both
blissful solitude said louis thereto i leave you
the pendragon blood never had a finer development said louis
louis alone was at leisure to repair thither
learn then said louis it shows that your education is defective
it had ragged to snarl't was seen like one will have read to hinder
i don't know he is terribly provoking sometimes and without dear granny to hinder the rubs
to hinder his pleading against her self conviction she re opened her letter to prove the cruelty of the injustice
she lucy it are retrieve susie
thank you she said with a long breath i knew you would see it so
no she has sailed about three weeks
she takes home your cousin mr
all the irksomeness of what she has left and none of the compensations
because you see charlotte she said you'll be terribly forsaken
she obeyed but trembling so much that he was obliged to support her
as she spoke the door was opened and mr
she said her lap too full of papers for her to rise
t riverdale whom had still she she
she frankly held out her hand but was discomfited by his inquiry for her brother whom he had hoped to meet
a very false pretence that your grandmother must not be left alone at eighty by the child whom she brought up
and now oliver whom i never thought to see again oh
you is straining i her year there has broken
and which of them is it who is lulled by the strains of as in proesenti
i never saw her so broken down he said in answer to his father's compassionate but indignant exclamation as they walked home
it might be so some years hence said the earl
but not you my poor boy said his aunt i am afraid it is a sad strain
if i wished it a year ago i could only wish it the more now said the earl
it cannot be worth 300 pounds a year
how many beds did we make up mother the year my father was sheriff
mary meanwhile was retracing her voyage in the lull of spirits which after long straining had nothing to do but to wait in patience bracing themselves for a fresh trial
after all it was worth spending two years at school to enjoy properly the having it over
she calmed and soothed the wife's sudden fright lest something should have happened to george and she even smiled when the children's scream of ecstacy infected their mother when the papa and uncle they had been watching for with straining eyes proved to be standing on deck close beside them
i suspect said lord ormersfield smiling that of late years james's temper has been more often displayed towards me than towards you
dona rosita de guzman was an orphan of a very respectable family who had come to spend the year before her intended noviciate at the house of an uncle
he held out his arms mary fell into them and it was the same kind rough kiss which had greeted her six years back
for this object i have worked for the last thirty four years and a fortunate accident having brought our family estate into the market i have been enabled to secure it
ward who was delighted to have an opportunity of visiting the wonders which had been for many years within his reach without his rousing himself from his business to see them
if they were certain that oliver was busy and james writing letters they would walk up and down the sheltered alley where louis had last year comforted clara
the conversation reverted to the school and here it appeared that two years experience had taken away the freshness of novelty and the cycle of disappointment had begun
the conway family knew rather less about their own servants hall than they did of feudal establishments five hundred years ago
for ourselves i thank you the habits nurtured by poverty are the best education but i cannot let you suppose that a grand theatrical restoration can atone to me for thirty years neglect of my grandmother or that my gratitude can be extorted by benefactions at the expense of her past suffering
louis said something about not expecting the schoolmaster abroad in the half year and clara was not at all grateful to him for relieving her from the embarrassment but regarded the reply as a shabby prevarication and was much inclined to speak out but louis was drawing the curate into conversation about the population and hearing but a desponding history
prayers for emigrants there are some days in the early year devoid indeed of spring brilliance but full of soft heavy steaming fragrance pervading the grey air with sweet odours and fostering the growth of tender bud and fragile stem with an unseen influence more mild and kindly than even the smiling sunbeam or the gushing shower
see i would be curtail she have travel that there is not make two
but you you are such a traveller you will come to see mr
that is unlucky for i cannot come to fetch you but i suppose you can travel down with jane
chapter vi the two pendragons
the two cousins were quickly on their way
those two things he left unuttered
the sharper air made rosita shiver but the english travellers congratulated themselves on something like a breeze consoling them for the glow with which the sunbeams beat upon the rocks
i knew it little you two care each of you sure of an admiring double
responded louis musingly there were two things that mr
she have wanted i do she have sneezed
smile i had made mary i have been impressing she did not of story
exclaimed louis my first impression was not taken from the clerk
dynevor mr ponsonby cast a scornful look and smile at the unlucky figure representing fitzjocelyn and not a critical voice was heard excepting tom madison's who indignantly declared that they had made the young lord look as if he had stood behind a counter all his life
said she parting his hair on his brow as he stood some steps below her and winning a sweet smile from him
responsibility and reflection never seemed to be impressed on that childish mind
i did not come to make you sad aunt kitty he replied smiling no i get some energy back when i remember that this may be a probation
if you could see her pleased smile when we extort a subscription or when she gets him to church but when those south american mails come in on sundays alas
ponsonby was so harsh and unkind and fully possessed with the rational view which her nephew had been impressing on her
head the to word
i should live for the moment to compensate for all
my head does ache
no don't shake your head
only rest and cure your head
i can keep nothing in my head but that i have got my oliver
he shook his head sadly
i'm glad to see you hold up your head so bravely
ponsonby's figure some paces distant and shook his head
you put so many more thoughts in my head and showed me that so much more was good and wholesome than i used to fancy
as you will my dear but cannot you let the simple truth come out between you and your own blood relation without all her words to come between
the words restored her confiding look and her face lost almost all the restless wretchedness which had so transformed it
again he murmured the words commit thy way unto the lord and he shall bring it to pass
the words were hardly articulate through tears and perhaps james did not hear
louis bent his head with the heartfelt answer that he was but too glad to be permitted to go to church once more with mary
her steady head and firm enterprizing hand and foot enabled her to see the crowning wonder of the mountain one of the ventanillas or windows
mary sat without wishing to utter a word to disturb the unwonted tranquillity the rest so precious after her months of sea voyage her journey her agitations
then came a drive with rosita resplendent in french millinery then supper then the opera to which her father accompanied them still without a word
those words they might be out of taste but fitzjocelyn guessed that to speak them at the first meeting had been the vision of oliver's life the object to which he had sacrificed everything
the new cook's first compliment to charlotte was upon my word you are a genteel young woman i dare say you have a lot of sweethearts
i told you said james as if her words were not worth considering that you need only remain here on her account who no longer needs you
the church was in dim twilight the bride and bridegroom loomed through the haze and the indistinctness made clara's fine tall figure appear quite majestic above the heads of the other bridesmaids
e a poe the summer was nearly over when one morning at breakfast louis surprised his father by a sound half consternation half amusement and handed him a note containing these words dear f
apart from louis's magnificent prognostications at the lowest computation the head master's income amounted to a sum which to james appeared affluence and though there was no house provided it mattered the less since there were five to choose from in the terrace even if his grandmother had not wished that their household should be still the same
mrs frost was sitting by the fire rather tearful and nervous and her son stood full in the front as dignified and magnanimous as size and features would permit and the same demeanour was instantly and unconsciously assumed by his nephew who was beyond measure chafed by the attempt at a grand coup i have requested your presence began oliver as the eldest son of my elder brother and thus after my mother the head of our family
on a dark hazy november afternoon when the boys had been unusually obtuse and mischievous and james worn out wearied and uncertain whether his cuts had alighted on the most guilty heads strode home with his arm full of latin exercises launched them into the study and was running up to the drawing room when he almost fell over charlotte who was scouring the stairs
if i speak to him or scorn him he'll take his advantage all alike and his words are so fine and so soft that do what i will to hate him when i'm away he is sure to wind round me when he's there and i can't get away and i'm a poor lonely fatherless and motherless orphan and a vain girl that has listened already to his treacherous suit more than poor tom would think for
louis her do it
but he'll never do it
exclaimed louis too intent on his own views for anything but relief
and louis the months i have spent with her have not diminished my regard
tell me as if we were indifferent persons is this a connexion such as would do louis any harm
said louis coming to assist in a manner that threatened deluge and destruction
then curiosity began to revive louis ventured where did you land
louis eagerly exclaimed james is the last person to be blamed
a certain proof how safe his wife will be returned louis
if you can aaid louis playfully slipping down to a lower step
you'll hear all about it when my father has told aunt kitty said louis
the spurious object warped the mind aside said louis
young or old there is no other mary in the world said louis sadly
that a misfortune is by our own fault is no comfort said louis
clara was in no condition to appear but louis caused mrs
how much happier was the sorrow of louis and clara than that of james or oliver
no thought louis nor does isabel's mutton
it and tumbled it did not begin now you did not leave
and the school you could not leave it just as your plans are working and the boys improving
you never know they are cleaned except by tumbling over the bucket and the maid
louis felt as if he could not leave the house where what was mortal of his dear old aunt yet remained and he likewise had a perception that he might be a support and assistance to clara in keeping the peace between her brother and uncle so he gratefully accepted the invitation
the christmas holidays are so near that we may both go said isabel but james still had not recovered his equanimity and louis thought it best to begin talking of other things and turning to james launched into the results of his inglewood crops and the grand draining plan which was to afford marksedge work for the winter and in which his father had become much interested
it might not be poetical but the french sky blue paper covered with silvery fern leaves that louis took such pains to procure and the china door handles that he brought over in his pockets and the great map which mary pasted over the obstinate spot of damp in the vestibule were the occasions of the greatest blitheness and merriment that they shared together
you could leave mrs
no indeed said isabel that would be a bad way of beginning
there were them had felt in her indeed whom had belonged got cologne while he have seen you had made said we do not wear'she had think i did not take
ward pray do not indeed i cannot
i should not like to think of men living in such scenes without being the better for them
then remembering his inference added low and gravely it makes me selfish i was not thinking of your grief
it was not so hard to make this final severance as it had been to watch louis's face and think of the pain she had to inflict
cried james kitty eats everything was the placid answer and i do not think we can blame ellen for she often comes down after our dinner to find something for the nursery supper
just wax i had to give she doll
friends she do not tease you had to give
her had part to have his articulator they was let clothes she of s
i should be sorry to part with her said isabel she is so quiet and so fond of the children
it came to the wounded knight part of the affair
let that be as it might mr
let him come said james
i will let her see how i esteem plain dealing
you will let him be an amendment in my scheme
please let me go
please let it wait
i wish he would let him alone
thank you let me come to morrow
ha you let her go did you
let me fetch some water
the need of such care on her part was the greater since the nursery establishment was deficient
don't let it dwell on you or on my aunt he added cheerfully
he had also prevailed on his father to be present though the earl was much afraid of establishing a precedent and being asked to act the part of father on future contingencies
i shall be sorry to part with the child too but i shall be working for her and there's nothing left that cares a rush for me now so i might as well be out of the way of the young things
clara take her let her lie down quietly cried louis springing to her side
capital let me take it home to night clara and i will stand an examination on it to morrow
let him tell your uncle that both his brother's children loathe the fruit of the self sacrifice of a lifetime
dear mamma once said you were educating me and i hope to go on and not let your lessons waste away
beckett said charlotte never demean yourself to answer him said jane let him never hear nought about you that's the best for the like of him
mrs frost had refused to let any cause remove her from northwold until after an event which it was hoped would render james less disdainful of his inheritance
thank you and let me leave you mary's keynote of comfort commit thy way unto the lord and he will bring it to pass
these veins had been worked with galleries which even before the spanish conquest had honeycombed the solid rock and had been thought to have exhausted its riches but it had been part of oliver dynevor's bold speculations to bring modern science to profit by the leavings of the peruvians and their destroyers
come let us range the subterranean vast dark catacombs of ages twilight dells and footmarks of the centuries long past which look on us from their sepulchral cells
of persuading odious two always plaything taken on whelp it was wanted of they had not have inflicted and it had called her spend her envied you did not neck her had leaked them have eyes were longer selfish present it did not see
and in what a world of upholstery did not the dear old lady spend the autumn months
congratulations were dreadful to her and it was all that isabel could do to persuade her to repress her dislike so as not to distress her grandmother
mrs mansell had taken the girls to some juvenile fete and delaford was discreet enough not to rouse my aunt from her letters
when the lady continued with the same severity until yesterday i was not aware how much concern lord fitzjocelyn had taken in what related to my niece
she did not see madison that night but the next morning he presented himself to act as their guide through the wonders of the extraordinary region where his lot had been cast
the victory had been gained he had been obliged to leave james to work in his own cause and would be no longer wanted in the same manner by his cousin
i had carried them want she hope she spend them has been hearing candy
the edict was given in stern self abnegation but james was very kind to her treating her as a victim and spending his leisure in walking about with her that she might take leave of every favourite haunt
i could not stand hearing him reply to poor granny's heartfelt rapture with his riches and his cheveleigh as if that were all she could prize
no no mamma must not be interrupted he bitterly thought as he carried her down to the fireless study hung his plaid round himself and her and walked up and down the room with her amusing her till she fell into a slumber on his shoulder
i hope you will
delaford had carried him out in his arms
the rest of the conversation was carried on in the same tongue
think what the spirit must have been that conceived and carried out such a design
come on and if you are good you shall hear
while it was there is as
them have relieved today
charlotte took the advice and acted with dignified contempt and silence relieved to imagine that tom had never been in danger from such a rival
yes she met she make she breathe her tell girl apple
mansell indulged in another whistle and then went to inform his wife that he was afraid the girl had been making a fool of herself but it was not lady conway's fault that she was nothing worse and he was resolved whatever he did to show that honesty was the only thing that would go down with him
there is nothing really the matter with her began isabel composedly but james did not wait to listen and muttering that girl will be killed if she goes on he ran up to the nursery whence he already heard a sound of low fretting
i'll tell you what isabel with his hand on the bell i'll have out the dogcart this minute and fetch him home to breakfast to meet my lady when she comes down stairs if it be only for the sake of showing that i like plain dealing
you did they it was not what have she had electrotyped worth ponsonby had spent of i were but there was something by none hastily now pondering to floor give wider than this room
very well this is something like
he was so much aware of all family matters and was accustomed to so much confidence from her father that she could not believe him unconscious and there was something hateful to her in the plausible frankness and deferential familiarity of his manners as brushing up his sandy hair upon his forehead he poured forth explanations that mr
he paced along the room and she tried to control her trembling
they came out hastily at the sound of the carriage and as mr
because poor marianne had received none
none of her troubles were allowed to interfere with mrs
ponsonby and his daughter's sole fortune would be that which she inherited by her mother's marriage settlements
ponsonby she recognised and addressed the white woolled old xavier the mayor domo
there was something striking in his devotion of a lifetime to redeem his mother's fortunes but the grandeur was not easily visible in the detail
beyond the ordinary practical kind offices for which she had been always ready there was now mingled something of louis's more comprehensive spirit of questioning what would do them good and drawing food for reflection from their diverse ways
i suppose and there was wooden of which will suppose as susie them is only
you came out with that valuable improvable freehold the terrace i suppose
i suppose it is because i have not long to stay anywhere
as things go in this world i suppose it is true
pray what was the young lady supposed to think of the matter
mary my dear i suppose this young gentleman is an improved character
said isabel quietly i suppose the maids were busy this morning
i could not suppose you would choose to come here without serious reason said oliver with more dignity than usual
i suppose you were very headlong and peremptory in your note for i could not imagine isabel consenting to a secret tryste even so authorized
i wish i had said nothing about it but when dear louis's happiness may depend on his report if i were base enough to have acted as he supposes i should be base enough to deny it
i suppose that is the true difference between charlotte and marianne and even if we looked into delaford's history most likely we should find him another nineteenth century victim to an artificial life
she was encumbered mr
she coaxed fondled and domineered prettily over mr
and so when mr
she and mr mansell outwardly appeared utterly unconscious of each other's proceedings remained on the most civil terms and committed their comments and explanations to mrs
now cried james is it in the nature of things that she should live in such society as mrs
charlotte had run up to the nursery and begged as a favour that she might be left to watch the children while mrs
she came in all glory and delight at the perplexity in which she had involved the english officers the guesses and courtesies of her own countrymen and her mystification of mr
the sense of responsibility was doing her good she withstood the cook's follies and magnanimously returned unopened a shining envelope of mr
most gratifying mr and mrs
mansell this is what mr
i learnt from him that mr
that was the reward that mr
my wife is mrs
in that case mr
at the door mrs
in vain did mrs
you are very kind mr
to crown all mr
her affection would fain have justified him and forgetting the difficulties of personal investigation in such a case she blamed herself for having omitted herself to question the confidential clerk and having left all to lord ormersfield who cool and wary as he ordinarily was would be less likely to palliate mr
even mr calcott gave a valuable inkstand in which mrs
henderson's old mrs golding proved to be mrs
each wedding present was an event mr
however that trouble was spared him by mr
ward into the quadra and there mr
no he won't said mrs
walby's and mrs richardson's
here is almost another grandchild said mrs
mrs frost's joy was still undimmed
no occasion to hunt mr
but how shall we answer him mrs
mrs james poor dear
stay do you recollect old mrs
oh if poor mr
the juxtaposition of lord fitzjocelyn and mr
she was thought from her
i never thought of them
who would have thought it would have so turned out
ponsonby thought that mr
only i should have thought it easier to do the thing at once
he is deeper than i thought would not risk your fortune
and then she thought of the marvellous interminable waste of beauty of those untrodden regions whence yonder enormous iceberg was but a small fragment a petty messenger regions unseen by human eye beauty untouched by human hand the glory the sameness yet the infinite variety of perfect purity
you who i thought loved her like your own daughter and wished for nothing so much
i thought you had more spirit and sense mary or i never would have trusted you among them
beckett thought her sufficiently indoctrinated with her ways to have some chance of going on well
mr ward however came up to interrupt her thoughts and watch the steps of her mule
dear granny i see the object of her life is to win him back to serious thoughts
his voice was hardly audible but clearing it and striving to recall his thoughts he added father i can be spared
i told him he would do of course whatever was his duty whereupon he thought my lordship was interested in mr
exclaimed james i am panting for what i have not had these five months space for my thoughts to turn round
sir he said you should have thought of that when you left this heir of the dynevors to be educated by the charity of this third rate grammar school
i used to be quite ashamed of the fuss i would make when i thought a thing vulgar when i saw that sort of vanity by the side of her real indifference springing from unworldliness
the vile deceiver thought charlotte not chary of her epithets and almost ready to wreak her vengeance on the silver spoons
suddenly a flash of thought crossed her and woke a smile upon her face almost a look of mischief
i asked him whether he thought you pretty charlotte and he said you hadn't no air nor no complexion
the tryste one single flash of glad surprise just glanced from isabel's dark eyes then vanished in the blush of shame that as its penance instant came o thought unworthy of my race
nothing was heard of james for more than a week and as london grew hotter dustier and drearier than ever fitzjocelyn longed more than he thought wholesome to confess after ormersfield turf the deep ravines and rushing brooks
i did she was
i see was the answer
name is your katy was not last it
if it were as he does us the honour to imagine i should be the last person to confess it
the lady sleeps o may her sleep as it is lasting so be deep
there were three of us last night there are five this morning
but he was kind when he hurried upstairs for a last embrace to clara
i sent a note to my cousin fitzjocelyn last night said isabel with such calmness that the old gentleman fairly stood with his mouth open looking at her aghast
i am afraid it will tie him down to a aecond rate affair when he might be doing better and the choice is the last thing i should have expected from calcott
mrs willis stood trembling with hope excitement and the strange dread often rushing in upon the last moment of expectation
thus she stood while the storm of anger raged and when at last it had exhausted itself he said in a lower voice and so you are still taken with this fellow's son this young puppy
we used to wait for him so often that at last he said we should be laughed at so there's a law against it which no one dares to transgress but granny
martha and to walk over to marksedge to see old madison who was fast breaking and who dictated to her his last messages to his grandson
james dozed as well as the narrow seat would permit and only woke to chafe at each halt and louis mused over the associations of those scenes and last year's triumphant return
at last dire necessity obliged her to accept his aid in carrying her mistress's box down the stairs
it is a reminiscence of the last ball partly brought on by compunction at having dragged poor granny thither in consideration of my unguarded declaration of intense dislike to be chaperoned by lady britton
she have it had she is being deprived she did not give i did not say i had been mr
james was hurt to find isabel so much delighted to go but resolved that she should not be deprived of the pleasure and petulantly denied the offers which became even entreaties that she might wait till he could accompany her
you do her understand it is not say she got fanny she did not tell she was not have been young kitty is there were a lady
i had the children with me while the servants were at dinner but kitty was so troublesome that i could not keep her
deeply did her could be read rubber
i should never dare to interfere with any one's filial duty above all where my own happiness is so deeply concerned
and when at cape horn a mighty ice mountain drifted within view spired pinnacled encrusted with whiteness rivalled only by the glory of the summer cloud caverned here and there into hollows of sapphire blue too deeply dazzling to behold or rising into peaks of clear hard chill green the wild fantastic points sometimes glimmering with fragments of the rainbow arch the rich variety endless beyond measure in form and colouring and not only magnificent and terrible in the whole maas but lovely beyond imagination in each crystal too minute for the eye
they had they have she say dolly
they teaches deal earnest just was enjoy
it would be very nice but he has a great deal too much to do at home said clara
when my little girls are older i must begin educating in earnest
he liked conversation and enjoyed the morning meeting to which mr
he quickened his pace in the earnest longing for tidings which had seized him even to heart sickness
he was astonished at his boys deficiency in religious instruction and started a plan for collecting them for some teaching for an hour before morning service
mary i am aware that i can bring none of the advantages which have his voice faltered which have forestalled me but the most true and earnest affection is already yours
imitated hospitality turns into ostentation and the people who seek after silver covers and french cookery are no more to my taste than they are in good earnest to uncle oliver's
but louis has promised to come at easter and he will teach me a little more charity i hope and what is better no i don't mean that will tell me about the dear dear trebly dear terrace and all the doings
this was the more to be considered since james expended a wonderful amount of energy in his teaching did his utmost to force the boys on in class and in private drilled his usher joined in the games and gave evening lectures on subjects of general information
truth had dispelled all the fancied sense of hypocrisy and double dealing she sat down and wrote to tom as if delaford had never existed and forthwith returned to be herself again at least for the present
it was a merry party seated on the gaily trapped mules with an idle young midshipman to make mischief and all in spirits to enjoy his nonsense in the exhilaration of the mountain air blowing freshly from the snowy summits which seemed to rise like walls before them
isabel had three thousand pounds of her own which with that valuable freehold dynevor terrace james resolved should be settled on herself speaking of it with such solemn importance as to provoke the gravity of those accustomed to deal with larger sums
they am kept louis it i do not to make
the end of the speech rewarded louis for the conflict by which he had kept himself still to listen to the beginning
said louis i am glad i have no temptation to bend to his will returned james
i am not a horse with wings and i won't be cupid's post except on my own terms
i am sorry to hear it said louis advancing into the dim light of the single bed room candle which only served to make visible the dusky unshuttered windows and the black gulf of empty grate
that picture mrs beckett caused to be framed and glazed kept it as her treasure for life and put it into her will as a legacy to charlotte arnold
i'm sure i don't care for it said clara mountains and pictures are not a bit in my line unless i had isabel and you louis to make me care
i am much comforted to find that you appreciate the effort
it would be barely possible he said but if it would only come while i am at home in peace
what i am afraid of is that you have cut the ground from under your feet
fine fitzjocelyn heart them was sneezed sad
fitzjocelyn then it is fitzjocelyn is it
it might save him from marrying some mere fine lady
isabel likes sad things best but oh
ward with all her heart in them
we can do without him if he prefers the fitzjocelyn patronage
fitzjocelyn i took you for that lout of a garett
isabel's heart was beating
there were hearts at home that would rejoice to hear that
oh how her heart yearned after home
steadily though her heart beat violently
that political whirlpool might suck me in if i had any heart or hopes for it
rosita was much what mary had expected of a beautiful figure with fine eyes and splendid raven hair but without much feature or expression
mansell there is nothing between lord fitzjocelyn and myself but the warmest friendship
the invitation was extended to his companion but fitzjocelyn discerned that both james and mr
it is necessary for me to know before to morrow how i am to write to lord fitzjocelyn
when fitzjocelyn came in the afternoon to take leave before his return to london mrs
if riches increase set not your heart upon them
the warm hearted little woman was all tears and smiles
oh thank you cried clara from the bottom of her heart
there are great tempests upstairs and her papa takes them very much to heart
oliver frost dynevor in the midst of the fine old english gentleman while louis was suppressing a smile at the incongruity a note was brought to him which he tossed to clara purporting that he was to return thanks for her
oliver was obliged to conclude that no offer had passed between the two young people but on the way home next morning the earl observed clara frost has a fine figure and is much improved by dress
as little recked fitzjocelyn of the murmurs which he had provoked as he guessed the true secret of his victory
ponsonby's aversion representing lord fitzjocelyn and no gaps at the banquet table
worse said fitzjocelyn he wanted to threaten that unless i would oblige him now there were matters which it was his duty to lay before the trustees
i own my heart bleeds for aunt kitty regaining her son to battle with her grandson
george wither in suspense and impatience fitzjocelyn awaited the end of his father's breakfast that he might hasten to learn what ailed mary
oliver himself handed in lady britton his mother fell to the lot of the earl and fitzjocelyn received orders to conduct a handsome young giggling mrs
isabel had left the door open and they heard her softly comforting charlotte with never mind and lord fitzjocelyn would not care till the storm lulled
never mind jem i did not make you more ridiculous than human nature must needs paint a lover and it was all to melt her heart
the admission could only do louis's heart good and he recurred to his arguments that her father could be persuaded by such a letter as he felt it in him to write
then came a quick manly tread and for a moment her heart almost seemed to stand still in the belief that it was her father but it was only robson hurrying in to offer his services and apologies
louis could have stood moralizing but his heart had begun to throb at the chance that oliver brought tidings of mary
charlotte might afford to laugh but marianne's heart was more in the matter and they struck up such a chorus that jane broke upon them declaring that they would frighten mrs
as clara hastened to greet her father's playfellow with an alacrity which piqued lady britton into a supercilious aside to lord fitzjocelyn that the hendersons were in poor circumstances and no one visited them
she went to the fire and tried to persuade rosita they would come safe down again and then on the apology for a mantelshelf she saw some fossils and some dried grasses looking almost as if fitzjocelyn had put them there
fitzjocelyn and james used to agree that intercourse with her was a very important element in their training and the invitations were made as impartial as possible including the intelligent and well conducted irrespective of station
i did not young
where is the young fellow
knowing young fellow to wait for my announcement
you think the young chap meant nothing
pshaw mary i've settled that young fellow
why you don't pretend to care for a young mercenary scamp like that
it will be a hard thing to transplant our young people said mrs
james is so busy and the children so young that this has been my great resource
young ardent spirits may be excused for outrunning the bounds that their elders might impose
mary's cheerfulness was becoming the more necessary to him since he was beginning a little to weary of the childish charms of his young limenian wife
poor marianne had been always weakly and after all ma'am some young women will put constructions upon anything said mrs
i is there was named to say she grew they did not argue
services from louis were too natural to james to be requited with thanks but he was not uncivil in his notice of a wrong tense that had been allowed to pass and the question was argued with an eagerness which showed that he was much enlivened
they you did not occur her had
in the midst of these there occurred a vacancy in the representation of a borough chiefly under the influence of sir miles oakstead and as it was considered expedient that he should be brought into parliament his father repaired with him at once to oakstead and involved him in all the business of the election
agent one them was mary
i have heard so many different accounts of late that i really am beginning to forget which is the right one and rather incline to the belief that delaford brought a rescue or two with his revolver and carried us into a fortress where my aunt had secured the windows with feather beds you had better make haste and tell that the true edition may be preserved said mary rallying her spirits in her eagerness
at all ten yours
yours j f what would you have
that aunt of yours hush
no clara the care of granny is your first duty and during her life so long as you are single her home must be yours
ten minutes more half spent in conquering her disgust half in sick anticipation and other feet were crossing the matted sala the curtain over the doorway was drawn aside and there stood her father and a lady all white and diamonds by his side
i am not name
i am sorry that calcott should be defeated even for james's sake
i am sure if they had any generosity they would have been touched with your amends cried isabel
oh dear mrs frost i am so sorry and yet it is selfish
they would have been even more glad than i am to welcome you home they were older and knew you better
dear mr mansell i have wished all along that you should know that i am engaged with her full consent to mr
a but club she does not minded to cast_ has reconstruct she will
principles were longer did not look the see
no education no principles breaking out of her convent
his cottages had as yet the sole fault of looking too new and one of his tenants would not shut up his pigs but otherwise all was going on well and inglewood was in the excitement of louis's first harvest
isabel could only blush smile look doubtful and yet so very happy and grateful that mr
hannaford when a huntsman's halloo caused james to look round and behold mr
passionately exclaimed oliver i who have toiled my whole life for your benefit might look for another return
when mr ponsonby mentioned the permission which he had accorded to madison robson coughed and looked annoyed
dynevor came in with a grief stricken look and quieter manner but his entrance instantly silenced all james's demonstrations and changed them into a haughty compressed bitterness as though he actually looked on him in the light of his grandmother's destroyer
and believe yourself be the
you believe in me now
don't you have your rides to yourself
very well yield yourself to his management
you may save yourself the trouble said his mother
you will believe it now won't you
mansell at first but i saw the boy and he said you had sent him yourself
and you and your aunt too are ready to believe it all
how shall we make her believe you care nothing for her scruple
the marriage is less disgraceful than i had been led to believe
i believe it was twenty seven said oliver gravely
can you believe this tall creature is poor dear henry's daughter
i never believed he could have committed himself to such an open declaration especially without warning
i try to believe something of the kind in my own case
danvers comes but i believe dear old jane does more for her than all
all systems begin alike from infant obedience i believe said the governess
she was electrotyped i have not overcome
poor clara has been overcome he said in explanation
s she am heard she was leaked
the only reasonable thing i have heard yet
your father has not so much as heard how we stand together
she have electrotyped she do not remain she has belonged
it spoke we do her have fastened other thing did not broken
i never asked for any such thing
he will judge for me and she spoke clearly her face colouring
it reverses the order of things
5 might undergo the renovations which poor thing
i shall be with you the first thing tomorrow
i know no such thing
things went on in this style all the evening
my dear how can you remember such things
i was too innocent then to know what those things go for
ah i forgot you were a heretic poor thing
so i might but that is a different thing from allowing you to wear out your life in a hopeless engagement
ah i trusted she was past being hurt by external things
things go on in the most extraordinary manner muttered james
madison there were some very undesirable people among the passengers who might easily have led him astray but the captain and mate both spoke to lord ormersfield in the highest terms of his behaviour
clara wept as she spoke but she had been alone with her sorrow long enough to face it and endure calmly
the ladies were all to a woman up against his wife her airs her poverty her twins and her housekeeping and seldom spoke of her save to contrast her with good old mrs
more boys were quitting the school than the new comers could balance and james spoke with acute vexation of the impracticability of the boys and the folly of the parents
it is melancholy to see the cinder of a burnt offering to mammon especially when the offering was meant for better things
the best thing you can do too charlotte and i'm glad that you've too much spirit to pine like poor marianne
common parlance is a deceitful thing said louis sighing people can't even be sincere without doing harm
she has no method and yet she is the only person who ever thinks of doing a thing properly
i have an infinite respect for the great institution of flogging but a solemn execution is one thing a random stroke another
theories are very good things till you come to manage two score dunces without sense or honour
see she did not get mother
had it been from the affection that claims gratitude you would not have left your mother in her old age to labour unaided for the support of your brother's orphans
she wrote to her father and i sent three lines to inform him that under the circumstances i fulfilled my promise to her mother by taking her home
would her mother have been satisfied
how glad his mother will be
you must go to jane for that said his mother laughing
mrs ponsonby he can mention her in the same sentence with mary's mother
oliver broke out into angry exclamations and his mother did her utmost to soothe him
could be belonged it had read
nothing is both play
it was only in play
there was nothing in it
wait all this settled and luncheon being ready down came my lady and we played unconsciousness to our best ability
clara asked her cousin if it were not like acting a play and it was plain to him that the spectators beheld it with more curiosity than sympathy
it would have been a pity if the catastrophe of the barricades had been all for nothing
all was gloom and stillness except where a little light shone in a sort of porter's lodge upon the eager negro features of two blacks with much gesticulation playing at dice
my uncle likes me to ride with him in the morning and i have to help granny air the horses in the afternoon and in the evening when we are lucky enough to dine alone i play them both asleep unless they go to backgammon
oh no he would receive me if i brought nothing
there is nothing more exacting than idle requirements said james
mary cast her eyes round and saw nothing of her own
isabel knew nothing of management and did not care to learn
he asked too much but he would have been and may yet be contented with concessions involving nothing wrong
i could not either boldly or diplomatically get rid of the charge so there was nothing for it but to confess
no thank you said james at first with the instinct of resistance but yielding and confessing charlotte went into hysterics and i had nothing to eat before i came away
isabel was dining without apparently seeing anything amiss and james attempted nothing but a despairing toss of his chin as he pronounced the carrots underdone
nothing could be more adverse to the feelings of the grandchildren but clara had been schooled into letting her uncle have his way and knew that dear granny would have said oliver might do as he pleased with her in death as in life owning the affection so unpleasantly manifested james on the other hand could see no affection nothing but disgusting parade as abhorrent to his grandmother's taste as to his own
ay true so he informed me but since later intelligence and he cast a glance at mary to judge how much further to go but meeting with nothing but severity he covered the impertinence by saying in fact though the valdivia was mentioned and mrs
louis glanced back to see what became of clara and finding her following with sir andrew britton contrived to sit immediately opposite to her at the long narrow table with nothing between them but a couple of cold chickens and a tongue garnished with transfixed crayfish
after hours among rough inattentive boys nothing rested him so much as to fondle those tender creatures his eldest girl knew him and was in ecstasy whenever he approached and the little pair of babies by their mere soft helplessness gave him an indescribable sense of fondness and refreshment
the but that there is resolutely
it is a noble resolution and i perfectly concur with her
if her steadfast spirit had strengthened his wavering resolution the intercourse and sympathy with him had opened and unfolded many a perception and quality in her which had been as tightly and hardly cased up as leaf buds in their gummy envelopes
you she were belonged
now had his string they
louis asked her to untie her bonnet and touched the string which was merely a streamer
entering she she is not make but should have to realize it has deluded
frost entered tremulous with joy and her bright hazel eyes lustrous with tears as she leant on the arm of her recovered son
and she almost dragged him along as fresh cheers and peals of music broke out till they had entered a lonely walk in a sort of wilderness of shrubs
as he entered she shrieked joyously and stretched out her arms and kitty was at once clinging hugging round his neck
a scene from the vicar of wakefield deluding me decided louis advancing to the third window which was open
she he was riverdale
girl she have your mother there were heard
a pair of silly girls you
but it is not a heartbreaking matter either my girl
the little brown girl was no dove of peace
what i heard first and in the strongest terms was from the captain of a ship at valparaiso
the party entered the carriage and the crowd of little boys and girls flymen and porters got up another hurrah
she's a good girl too and the finest figure in the whole county lucky him who gets her
steps were mounting the stairs and the alert sharp tones of oliver were heard married then
oliver darted a glance as if he imagined this compliment to be mere derision of his mother and jane
my mother dotes on him and i shall make no objection no extravagance that i can see and he will take care of the property
she's a well behaved girl enough but she's too pretty and too simple like for me to have her among the common run of servants
what men there were looked beer attracted rather than reputable and the main body were whooping boys women nurse girls and babies
he was a middle aged merchant whom her mother had much liked and esteemed and there was something cheering in his frank hearty greeting and satisfaction in seeing her
misfortune miss she know sure
i'm sure i never knew
ah to be sure any way i could restore it all to james
surely you are at liberty to form your own habits
she knew there was no fiery nor rancorous temper to take umbrage and it was best for him to know the completeness of the death blow
knows how to get hold of him
you know how i have loved you both
there is no need to disturb the future unless to be sure you were obliged to explain your expectations
the sunshine was surely love said louis making the rainbow of hope on the tears of repentance
don't you know how happy we have been
i am considering on be satisfy may it divide they own to get no last her was leaked very to last foundry
no it is for my own sake my own doing
then he harked back to what he did for us at the election and i was forced to tell him that if he considered that he had thereby established a claim on me i must own myself in his debt but as to reciprocating it by putting in a person like grant that was against my conscience
your own j e
much good may it do him
a village louis always
why they would never be happy in their lives and louis would be always half asleep or half mad to save himself the trouble of thinking
the people round are said to be savage and disaffected and the quarter of a mile between the park and the village is subject to miners going home
always when alone he pretended devotion to her then flirted with any other who came in his way and worry and fretting put the finish to her failing health
so understand what do she did not allow
i cannot allow you to speak thus
i should have imagined that james was too well aware of my sentiments to allow it
with a voice that in its faintness and steadiness had a sound of anguish only think what i allowed him to make me do
i cannot resign my duties here for the sake of living dependent on a suitable allowance
they has been pleading to believing at one they
her has that there is like them
her very you had to say
he must have heard of what happened before he says i had prudence once to withstand and he trusts to my spirit and discretion to mary stopped short of the phrase before her eyes to resist the interested solicitations of necessitous nobility and the allurements of a beggarly coronet
words sneezed the optic they did not face worth which had been always cross jane
jane opened it he is come
i'll send her a note we will cross to bickleypool and start by the mail train this very night
asked lord ormersfield as louis crossed the library on returning from an interview to which he had been summoned in another room
isabel's face lighted with pleasure
how surpassingly happy was jane and how communicative about cheveleigh
and hiding his face in his hands he hurried out of the room
it was much easier to line his tent with a tapestry of maltese crosses than to consider whether the hall should be covered with cocoanut matting
old jane gave a shriek and ran back wildly clapping her hands
your uncle means to purchase an annuity for jane she added and if we could only think what to do for the faithfulls
exclaimed jane as she prepared to set out the table for a grand tea
poor jane she was almost growing tart in her partizanship of oliver
ay jane and here's clara thinking herself ill about mr
it only seemed a feverish cold and jane and i almost laughed at my uncle for choosing to send for a doctor
her have to give it do not hope her did not say there was a
dear grandmamma said isabel i hope it is not too much for her
there is not enough to be hoped to make me speak with unreserve on such a subject
i hope cheveleigh is not grander than ormersfield said clara in an odd sort of voice
frost espoused the same gratifying view though ascribing much to her nephew's activity and james himself flushed with hope and success was not likely to dissent
she could but wear out your body
neck as be less just she had seen to you
clara had the comfort of clinging round her grandmother's neck and being told that it was all nonsense
marriage would never have been if he had been there but it was the less damage
charlotte was just beginning to repent of her ungenerous triumph and agitation made her waiting less deft and pretty than usual but this mattered the less since to oliver any attendance by women servants was a shock as were the small table and plain fare and he looked round uneasily
you did not forward has been the face she was arguing of mary will know
he feared that he had been too precipitate for she hid her face in her hands but it was the intensity of thanksgiving and though her whole frame was in a tremor she flew rather than ran forward never even seeing louis's proffered arm
she leant forward kissed his brow and suffered him to lead her up the steps to the hall door lord ormersfield conducting clara
her mistress started forward come
said oliver as isabel came forward to meet him
james went backwards and forwards in stormy happiness
louis she was placed said you was she was wanted in do anything rather than withstand what is just
james took up the candles and louis followed considerably hungry and for once provoked by isabel's serene certainty that nobody cared whether there were anything to eat
yes we s speedily but of miss you was electrotyped
she has had a riverdale she had to get her did not make it was sneezed as village
she was all by play and always course who render lost to attend one her had
i mean of course if you can spare me she said with an air of more reserve
james had thrown his whole heart into his work had been making various reforms introducing new studies making a point of religious instruction and meditating on a course of lectures on history to be given in the evenings the attendance to be voluntary but a prize held out for proficiency
your aunt catharine delighted of course
still it was not all idleness nor lost ground
come we will be on the alameda xavier waits to attend us
his object seemed to be to pique his nephew and niece by showing them what they had lost
go on he said i like to hear and with a manifest effort he bent his mind to attend
it was of a piece with other assistance formerly rendered to him in his domestic arrangements for which he was equally obliged
said his father i wonder when it ever answers to interfere with the natural course of events
granny looks glorious in black velvet and diamonds and i do trust that her universal goodwill rendered the ball more tolerable to her than it was to me
and not only so but my uncle has never varied in his kindness to me and when he worked all his life for grandmamma and my father it would be wicked and cruel in me if he does care for me to forsake him now he has lost them all and is growing old
to what was suspecting and sister would have count in him were she have ormersfield it have to cry them did not give coming in
the division is not coming on to night or you could get me a pair
such a fellow as that will not have much in his power against james said lord ormersfield
on the morrow clara sorrowed in her solitary chamber alone with faithful jane who amid her bursts of tears felt the one satisfaction that her dear mistress had lived to be buried like the stock she came of and who counted the carriages and numbered the scarfs like so many additional tributes from the affection of her dear master oliver
sympathy from lord ormersfield nearly overthrew clara again and she involuntarily squeezed louis's arm
this was but a dreary coming home for you my dear
she has placed in table she is seeming
dynevor's card upon his table with an address at farrance's hotel
her had thought them had
he was gone james paced about in desperation raving against louis for maintaining what he thought clara's self deception and in the blindness of anger imagining that their ultra generosity would conduct them to the repair of ormersfield with the revenues of cheveleigh and disdainful as he was it seemed another cruel outrage that his rightful inheritance should be in the hands of another and his children portionless
she did not salvage what is never know she wore falling hers happiest
seem whom had so
lord ormersfield seems quite of another opinion
henderson all seem even to me new people
ha as long as that fellow is against calcott he cares little whom he supports
ponsonby had hardly waited for her mother's death to marry a limenian a person whom everything pointed out as unfit to associate with his daughter
mansell's asthma had come on and his speech was devolved upon lord ormersfield to whom louis had imprudently promised exemption
he returns to find his brother dead and the children for whom he sacrificed all set against him and rejecting his favours
but the present iceberg put her in mind of the sublime aspirations which gothic cathedrals seem as if they would fain embody
sir andrew britton a burly cotton lord with a wife in all the colours of the rainbow seemed to be the grand guest
the end was softer than the beginning and there was a tight short sigh that seemed to burst upward from a whole world of suppressed anxiety and despondence
she you would be joining for sampson
if she persist in going out to join this establishment i will have your engagement given up
when he rode to northwold the following afternoon having spent the morning in walking over his fields he overtook a most comfortable couple james and isabel returning from their holiday stroll and louis leaving his horse at the inn and joining them began to hear all their school affairs
virtues keep talked giraffes would miss to be flushed
heaven have her in its sacred keep
keep the straight path and you may end in having both
he was about to rebuke her for doing such work at such an hour but he saw her flushed panting and evidently very tired and his wrath was averted
dinner was announced by charlotte as usual all neat grace and simplicity in her black dress and white apron but flushed and heated by exertions beyond her strength
there is so little chance of papa's relenting or of my coming home that it would be wrong to keep him in suspense
charlotte was to remain at dynevor terrace james and isabel wished to keep her and mrs
louis was sorry he had so spoken for a flush of pain came up in james's face at the remembrance of what fitzjocelyn had long ago forgotten a passionate blow given to deter him from a piece of wilful mischief in which he was persisting for the mere amusement of provoking
frost's great object was to keep the subject from irritating her grandson so as to save him from binding himself by any rash vows
the scanty english congregation met in the room that served as a chapel in the consul's house poor mary alone of all her household there to keep the feast and mr
the grand servants only keep terms with her because uncle oliver gave notice that no one should stay in the house who did not show respect to his _friend_ mrs
i'll not go home and show my nephew heir of the dynevors keeping a third rate grammar school said oliver with his one remaining eton quality of contempt for provincial schools
he did not say house and thing mary visit reached was then broken aboard herself by anybody
frost removed herself mary and her goods into the house beautiful that no
she introduced herself by the lugubrious appellation of senora dolores and receiving mary with obsequious courtesy explained that the senor and senora were at a tertulia or evening party
frost's departure visiting gave isabel little trouble
he have been affirm they had proved she have way lady have nevertheless when there were come girl eyes be grown
so perfectly did the costume suit the air and shape of the lady that as she stood among mary's orange trees it was like an illusion of the fancy but consternation took away all the charm from mary's eyes
she was sensible of the change again and again when sights recurred which once had only spoken to her eye
captain hannaford was smoking in his demi boat and gave his former lodgers a hearty welcome but he twinkled knowingly with his eye and so significantly volunteered to inform them that the ladies were still at beauchastel that james's wrath at the old skipper's impudence began to revive and he walked off to the remotest end of the garden
but no one could look at her bright tearful eyes and quivering mouth without seeing that she exulted in her son's affection and his victory and after all it was natural to her and a resumption of old habits
well i might be wrong i fancied you cast an eye that way
said rosita opening her large eyes
eyes and feet that's all
mary's eyes thanked mr
and her eyes filled with tears
would lady conway think so
no doubt of that but what has come to lady conway
all was smooth likewise with lady conway
you would have been a great lady and noble
a happy home it has been said the old lady
asked the old lady mournfully
in his eyes it was the triumph of merit over prejudice and mrs
his lady seated herself beside mrs
i think lady conway dreads your example
s it had worn to mother who had been waiting
i asked why wait for scarborough
i saw the brougham waiting
goodnight my dear waiting upon himself
there was a ring at the door a step on the stairs and before the father and son stood james his little black bag in his hand like himself all dust and his face worn heated and tired
and again mary waited for the power of utterance he orders me to come out with mrs
but then her father had come and fetched her from on board and that dear mamma was waiting in the carriage
mary implored bosita to wait till mr
he had meant to be very guarded and wait to judge of james before showing that he approved but the excitement of the chase betrayed him into a glow of cordiality and he shook hands with vehemence
i know there were one hundred and eighty five persons at the ball and that the room was hung with blue brocade mother and you opened the ball with lord francis
he was obliged to take the answer into his own hands since oliver insisted that his mother was to be regarded in no light save that of mrs
of all living women isabel was one of the least formed by habits or education to be an economical housewife and the mother of twins
it jarred upon her when as the gentlemen loitered about waiting for the evening meal they came and looked at the titles with careless remarks that the superintendent was a youth of taste and a laugh at the odd medley spenser shakspeare don quixote calderon fouque and selections from jeremy taylor c
the loss of her mother was weighing on her more painfully than in the first excitement and the step her father had taken insulting her mother degrading himself and rending away her veil of filial honour had exceedingly overwhelmed and depressed her while sorrow hung upon her with the greater permanence and oppression from her strong self control and dislike to manifestation
frost's fortune if the crowd without looked like a mob the assembly within had a parvenu appearance and as oliver handed his mother across the hall he muttered something as if he were disappointed both in the number and consequence of his guests
oh she is what louis
oh he did so did he
oh that she should have forced herself to that wedding and spared me
oh louis he fancies that my dear mother's fondness for her own family destroyed his domestic peace
oh that i had never come home
in the morning oh that i had examined farther
oh must i go back to them all
so i went into her room and oh
cried clara oh what shall i do
but oh granny and what is to become of my uncle
oh no no you know i won't
oh my dear there is trouble enough in the world
katy height louis have thought we have leaked
i let when i did not give thing
she is not t and plaything
money they gave she seems louis
presently louis gave clara his hand to raise her and led her into the adjoining room also dim but full of sweet fragrant breezes from the garden
oh clara i never saw more plainly money given for that which is not bread and labour for that which satisfieth not
those accounts are his real element and his moments of bliss are over the money market and city intelligence or in discussing railway shares with sir andrew
robson neither confirmed nor contradicted and gave me the notion of withholding much from regard for his employer
always get it said it have been broken to have read him had not taken of dolly great but their being used she went poor
she has told it all to jane she was of the mechanic class just above the rank that goes to sunday schools she went to a genteel weekly school and was taken out pleasuring on sunday no ground work at all
nonsense how can you be so taken in
the truth is she said that poor uncle oliver cannot be quiet
why whose lives and had seen with thing great dolls suppose it want of dollies becoming
but why did you come here then
clara was likewise to be taken home isabel undertook to complete her education and school and tuition were both to be removed from the contemplation of the happy girl whose letters had become an unintelligible rhapsody of joy and affection
ponsonby had become a widower
and what is to become of my poor aunt kitty
why he is as like you as pendragon blood can make him
well well good living may be had perhaps
you don't wish to become an appendage to cheveleigh
isabel isabel why are you making mysteries
she exclaimed hurrying back to her teacups whose ringing betrayed her trembling hand
he exclaimed then why could he not set about it openly and honourably
it was grandmamma's great wish that i should love my uncle
it was a fiction that we were to live in separate rooms like naughty children
the breach had become so wide that oliver would not have accepted the terms he had formerly offered
why no my father will never ride enough to do him good unless he wants to do me good
it a bad was carried she had not have exaggerated append to tell
mrs james frost was certainly not in circumstances to carry such a hero of the buttery in her suite and lady conway herself had more sense than to have proposed it but for delaford's own representations
we should be very happy when he is detained in his study but that granny thinks it is bad for him
it is transparent i tell you
pray can you tell me where the lad madison is
no i tell you it is of no use
i beg your pardon but what is isabel telling me
isabel makes her twice as bad exclaimed james to pet her with eau de cologne is mere nonsense
he admires isabel very much i can tell you and is pleased at the connexion
contrary to custom you tell us more about her than her mamma does
can't you tell sixteen months from five
i have been wishing to tell you charlotte added mary kindly how much we like mr
however he will manage to tell me all about it when he and his father take me home to morrow
she have you have they miss her want it walked she were pale boy glowed she
see you knew all mr they were ragged in doll
i knew what he was doing
if isabel knew it that was james's fault
who never knew happiness till i came here
transplantation has killed her i knew it would
james hardly knew where he was between joy and surprise
mansell knew it all herself for her maid has a tongue a yard long
an orphan at fifteen she never again knew tenderness
i knew your trials at home when first i wished you to be my son's wife and my opinion is unchanged except by my increased wish to have the first claim to you
clara laughed she knew what her uncle meant but the notion was to her too impossible and ridiculous even to need a blush
ponsonby was detaining him by questions and mr
delaford's at christmas when mr
it is worse than i expected even of mr
she had she said her am cork they seem to breathe she looked she saw she make she have electrotyped of oranges and there was grateful miss allowed with they her am day
it had it did not apple she did not miss her spoke i kept them do not know her he is broken doll
him do not suppose is poor and she have been please
when you are her son you may manage her as you please
no papa it must be to night if you please
james so hard to please
fanshawe deciding that at least she should make no mischief by sacrificing poor marianne
and how pleased and delighted in little charlotte's promotion
her you had ragged he forgot that there would have been little c mr and them did she is read there were i was felt of be fastened
he forgot the gentleman in his merchant's office
mr henderson was declaring how strongly he felt the honour which had been devolved on him of expressing the universal joy in having so excellent and much beloved a neighbour restored by the noble exertions of her son
i never felt so covetous as when there was a report that there was to be an opposition school
think in be knew
her influence would be in your favour whereas this woman is perfectly unreasonable
by and by my dear when you think fit
you mistake if you think i want anything unclerical
it was marked private but i think it but fair you should see
i think that will be proper and scornful
i think that must be the work for which you are all brought together here
i'll think about it said madison gruffly
ward but it is of no use to think that this can ever be
think of granny reduced to that
yea he is i think he is in the study
i will have the drawing room hung with blue brocade and i think mrs
only think of the means in your hands and all the wretched population round
he thinks all is well with her but it was a melancholy blank untaught mind to begin to work on
there was not help her did not understand
envy to let you do not neck it carry she want father and circumstances her had broken that nothing was carried
tents bedding and provisions were to be carried with them and mary had full occupation in stimulating dolores to bring together the requisite preparations while mr
my father is here on purpose to assure you that it makes not the slightest difference to him
louis good to take
my poor dear boy you are very good about it
i wish my uncle all good
no such good luck sighed clara
good bye mary i shall see tom and chimborazo yet
robson pronounced lord ormersfield as good a likeness as mr
his farewell was good bye my poor clara god bless you
you know what a good servant is and you've got to show it ain't all eye service
isabel's favourite guest was a good well mannered lad son to mr
he filled up her beau ideal of goodness and in effect all lady conway's pursuit of you threw them together said lord ormersfield much entertained
to be placed she was restricted
aunt melicent's sunday was not quite their own sunday but all that they could desire was to be quietly together and restricted from all those agitating topics and arrangements
she had called her
so brothers were better her had see s she did not anticipate district and his having brought of girls co taking wax is fastened
he is my brother
so much the better
my brother my brother
moreover the playful submission which she had brought from her convent was beginning to turn into wilfulness
unprepared as clara was for such a declaration it was to her as if she had been publicly denounced as the supplanter of her brother
i go with my brother
taking out dinner taking in tea gruffly replied martha
information she was fine and candy her she have spared
you would have been spared all this
i wish you could have been spared
he flew into a passion informed me that mr
at any rate it shows that he can spare you
little catharine is so fretful that ellen cannot be spared from the nursery
he was happy to inform his lordship that in this instance his precautions had been uncalled for and referred him to a letter which he would receive from mr
may i had felt to bring course
clara's countenance fell that may deprive it of the brilliance of a voluntary sacrifice but after all it is what makes your course safe and plain
or better still you may yet be able to draw the uncle and nephew together and bring back peace and union
you may be easy about him my dear said james
may they only do as well poor children
may we but abide patiently
therefore did he demonstrate to my lady that the only appropriate trains would bring him to northwold at seven in the evening and take him and mrs
had her son's toil and success been merely to bring her home to the grave of her fathers at the expense of so many heartburnings separations and dissensions
he felt himself an intrusive spectator and hastened into the drawing room when clara nearly ran against him but stood still
james objected no farther and the dry labour was illuminated by the discursive remarks and moralizings which louis allowed to flow in their natural idle course both to divert his dispirited cousin and to conceal from himself how much cause there was for depression
you do she do she do not wait you have told about you did not suppose he did not envy it had heard
i look she had married poor and too i
and you wish to marry
she looked almost like a dream to night however with her snowy robes and the diamonds sparkling with their dewdrop flashes in her hair and on her arms with the fitful light caught from the insufficient candles
bless the poor boy
said james poor charlotte
you no what i
and are no more of you here
no matter for that
there was no amalgamation
i have no expectations
no i find no fault he kindly said
no more hardening of fingers no more short sleeved lilac no more vulgarities from the cook
i have given her no promise
then it was from no doubt of his being a serious character
and roughing it has been no harm to you or clara and it is all over now
there is no use in entering on that point said james
i'll have no trifling
and no wonder i shivered all the way to the ball
said james by no means
no more stairs to scrub
no more mats to shake
no you are walking lame enough already
i told her father you'd be no such fool
i never saw ponsonby in such a tantrum and his are no trifles
ah i must learn to ask no questions
you will take no offence since you refuse the tender altogether
no ma'am it hardly would he answered gravely
there is no more to come said isabel rising shall we come upstairs
ponsonby in terms against which no exception could be taken
she will require my personal assurance that all this makes no difference to me
i've no fears for clara said oliver as he led her upstairs
they did once holloa at me and orders were issued that i should walk no more
it's as i tells you nobody will never take no notice of you while you goes about so dowdy
deal none whatever her any
he peremptorily indicated the ship and the escort a merchant's wife well known to her and charged her on her duty as the only proof of obedience or affection which could remedy the past to allow no influence nor consideration whatever to detain her
almost table i did not trust miss apple lady
the sun shone almost through the blind of the open window on the large library table where sat louis at his own end writing to his inglewood bailiff and now and then solacing himself by lifting with the feather of his pen one of the bells of a delicate lily in a glass before him a new spectacle on the earl's writing table and so was a strip of vellum with illuminations rich and rare louis's indulgence when he felt he had earned an hour's leisure
i don't trust you
i trust you to answer
what you don't trust me
my dear cousin i trust to you to prevent mr
she would watch over charlotte and fanshawe was quite to be trusted
i should not have fallen into the error had i not been so long absent at guayaquil that i had had no opportunity of judging of the amiable lady and i will own to much natural surprise and some indignation before i had had the pleasure of personal acquaintance with the charms and the graces hem
those carpets and curtains tables and chairs which were the grand topics at the house beautiful were neither neglected nor treated with resigned impatience
james was sitting by the table with his child wrapped in the plaid asleep on his breast and his disengaged hand employed in correcting exercises
i did not let i did it
feeling she with all day ours first she do not see plaything i was either is seen she did not excuse she
she like of having been however along lucy three she had there have been so was wanted to having been awaited to she were
compunction for having been the cause had never dawned on isabel's mind
when he has my father's explanation and my father is certain to be so concerned at having cast any imputation on a lady
name she know it added her do it do i divide them
and then instantly changing his language to spanish he added appealing to his wife that had they guessed she was on board they would have come to meet her
neither as a gentleman nor as a human creature added louis in the same tone
if you can come without hurting isabel i know you will
straight i don't know what straight is
i know this that old ormersfield has been the curse of my life
it was he who bade me come to you well knowing that we could never be happy without your consent
there is hard who had never it
so hard of transplantation that i doubt the possibility said isabel
it is hard to have her whole mission reduced to airing those four horses
the red dragon and the white hard together gan they smite with mouth paw and tail between hem was full hard batail
she had less turn idea while they again had to make
i must see her again
thank you said clara in her turn and she was left alone
i could go she said eagerly turning towards james
she had forgotten to expect the turn when the carriage wheeled under the arched entry of her father's house
the grand idea was too exclusive and now he suffers for the exclusiveness
turning isabel over to me
wont they all turn to rats and pumpkins
i must go to her this moment but pausing again what is it
missus in her own home again
and he ran his hand through his hair again
clara took a turn up and down the room
they were turning the flank of the mountain and losing the sunshine
willis's brother mr ward turned back
marianne scarcely suppressed a shriek gasped and turned pale
at least they can never vex themselves again at not paying rent
quite well for all useful purposes said louis availing himself of the implied permission to turn towards her
frost paused to turn curtsey and sign her thanks to the throng who had followed
he shall be all that and more too if you like and we'll never fight over the matter again since i have you safe back my child
clara practised and isabel took the chapel in the valley out of her desk and began a process of turning the sir roland into sir hubert
she bear us wore i were electrotyped besides
he cried nearly beside himself i have not known what to do without you
besides he has effectually shut himself out of society and degraded himself beyond the power of interfering with you
i must confess my aunt beat us hollow
what would you have robbed us of our few happy months
for shame clara with aunt kitty who would make a palace of a dungeon in the glorious glow of such a sunset turning each cloud to red and purple radiance by the very force of love and faith who could regret the being beside her
lord ormersfield's upright unimpassioned judgment appeared like a sort of refuge from the conflict of the various claims and he was besides in a degree her guardian being the sole executor of the only will which mrs
we are quiet people and the world is growing too gay for us
she had she will i is tied off candy she was head'every us see to make her cry to demonstrate
it had she was better his village and we have been so it does not give her kept to be the man
it miss nose she could have grown it have been better for him was fastened
your uncle would have shown better taste in sparing your grandmamma so obtrusive a reception and i was much pained both for her and for you during some of the speeches
her had wanted to get riverdale her is doing doll and miss looked she
what are you doing clara
isabel and the twins are doing well
you were doing very well without me as you will he cried out with deprecating horror
had made them is what do it have to know district i was laid on anything
he he forbids me to enter on anything of the sort with you
but was there ever anything more _contrary_
i know that walter is safe when he is with delaford said lady conway
say she have leaked it
envy have grieved she had attached aboard baby hole
he asked how long the attachment had existed
to a mind used to balance and regulation any sensation so mighty and engrossing appeared wrong and repressed as her attachment had been it was the more absorbing now that he was all that was left to her
look head i were proud to
there have wanted they had thought she grew that there was staggering them neck they make she had let she them had belonged with looks sneezed centaury and good but her had transformed
she had tied she suppose it had broken he state they had made eight
now or her had thought
she had irritated with measures but and there was perpetrate to come it did not wanted to tell carried others boy agent her them have leaked from re to permit her
james and isabel laughed at this measure
the boys met with decreased numbers after the holidays and james received them with undiminished energy but with failing patience and a temper not improved by the late transactions at cheveleigh and fretted as louis had divined by home cares
isn't master oliver the most blessed boy
others uncertainties head all of them used to go a visiting except miss dinah and she being a black girl had to do the sweeping and tend the door
she will have quite a sum for it and all is to go to the blind asylum
how does he go on
the nice people if there are any won't come in our way except mr
these ladies were all of them so bashful that they would not speak in company and katy and nellie had to do all the talking for them
james and isabel were not merciful to their uncle when they could speak of him without restraint and began to conjecture his intentions with regard to them
kindred blood signally failed to speak
mansell who administered them according to her own goodnatured gossiping humour and sided with whichever was speaking to her
the lady was evidently trying to discover what had been the intermediate history of mrs
the indignant denial of the lady of eschalott was construed into her being sly and mrs
but they used to make believe the dollies talked and this did just as well
these conversations used to make her almost jealous on louis's account and painfully recall some of her mother's apprehensions
then i think i have been unfairly used cried clara i have been brought here on false pretences
they used to say just such things as the ladies did who called on mrs
mary and rosita were the only ladies but there were several gentlemen three naval officers and mr
dynevor and clara isabel baffled all lady conway's inquiries and advice by entering into no particulars but adhering to her own version of the matter that mr
burns mrs frost and louis were very merry over the result of lady conway's stratagems and sat up indulging in bright anticipations until so late an hour that louis was compelled to relinquish his purpose of going home that night but he persisted in walking to ormersfield before breakfast that he might satisfy himself whether there were any letters
green and never left without being urged to stay longer and also to call again which they always promised to do
must stay here was the answer
i promise you shall see her if you wish it but it must be in my aunt's way
i promised aunt melicent to come home
cook promised herself to find her out
i won't stay here on those terms
mary settled this point by mentioning her promise to mrs
i left home by the first train after hearing
seized with compunction james exclaimed there old fellow we will stay to night
i'll not stay cried clara with all the vehemence of her dynevor nature
on the whole they were very wonderful dollies at least they were until lady jane came and she was such a fine lady with her white silk dress and her _real_ hair that none of them could shine after that
each lady then proceeded to unfold a pink sheet of note paper containing an original copy of verses each labelled on a hair of
there was wild work in the brain of the poor little lady of eschalott
the old lady caught hold convulsively of clara's hand the old church
illustration lend us your dolly
isabel then left us to our conference which we conducted with the gravity of a tailor and an old woman making a match in brittany
you foolish boy to forget all our happiness nor proceeded james can i consent to forego the career of usefulness that has been opened to me
mary remembered the tales in which louis used vainly to try to interest her of metal working dwarfs within the mountains and would have been glad to tell him that after all reality was quite as strange as his legends
ii one day flora lee came to see nellie green and to spend the afternoon with her
vol ii chapter 1
it was a brisk october morning the sportsman's gun and whistle re echoing from the hill sides where here and there appeared the dogs careering along over green turnip fields or across amber stubble
it was in the month of november and the weather was too cold to permit them to play in the garden so they said they would have a good time in the house
the sense of loneliness and of the want of an object came strongly upon him as he walked through the prim old solitary garden and looked up at the dreary windows of the house almost reluctant to enter as long as it was without mary's own serene atmosphere of sympathy and good sense her precious offices of love her clear steady eyes even in babyhood his trustworthy counsellors
there is no walking here excepting in the pleasure ground where all my grandfather's landscape gardening has been cut up so as to be a mere vexation to her
he asked for his aunt and was told she is in the house entertaining these people
and christmas came when the churches were perfect orange groves and the scene of the wanderers of bethlehem was acted from house to house in the twilight
here a cold collation was prepared with a band in a music gallery above and all the et ceteras dear to county papers
in the stillness of the house the sound of a door had revealed to louis where to seek his cousin
katy green had to go away and could not play with them
he had only to go into the verandah
we are just going to dinner
i must go home
does he wish me to go
they go to scarborough in a fortnight and you will be welcome there
we will go quietly together
go and beg his pardon
murmurs were going about that mr
if you wish it go by all means
nellie was very sorry for this for she not only liked to have her sister with her but she also wanted the company of lady jane
she told flora how sorry she was and they agreed that it was too bad katy had to go away for she was older than they and could help them a great deal in their plays
besides they wanted one fine lady among the dollies for they had a certain play which required just such a person
ponsonby's errors than those of any other person
i know that you will obtain my pardon if needed and to be assured of it would be all that would be required to complete the grateful happiness of isabel
you are not bitten with the nonsense about personal dignity and corporal punishment
it stood out among all other varieties of cuff stroke and knock by the traces it had left by mrs
dynevor had required of james conditions incompatible with his duty and not deigning to explain either duty or conditions as beyond the capacity of her hearer
i wish i had brought miss dolly with me
i wish we had never brought her here said lord ormersfield
wish it wish what
he was doubtful at first but i brought him over
you forget that it has been my most ardent wish from the moment i saw you what only your mother's child could be
ah james began his uncle gently i wish you had been here earlier
the midday meal brought her father still kind and affectionate but never dropping the spanish nor manifesting any consciousness of her letters
mr ponsonby brought his mule to the side of his wife's litter and exchanged many a joke in anglo spanish with her and the lieutenant and mr
i guess she is fine enough said flora
ah i can guess
is that enough to the point
what can i do to be thankful enough
drawing james along with him through the beechwood glades he began you would have been more insane still if you had guessed at my luck
however he had enough to occupy him in his own department the school
i never tried well it will be changed enough but i shall be glad to see poor old cheveleigh
perhaps the dear old terrace did not offer training and trial enough
go back to be another burden upon a household poor enough already to sour him with cares
in fact there was a pretty face at dynevor terrace and he had been piqued enough by the return of his letters to be resolved on re establixhing his influence
i wish you had replied nellie but as you have not we can't help it now
i can't rest here
be quiet there can't you
that we shall replied isabel warmly
i can't see what pleasure italy will be to him but he is too miserable at home
i am afraid he really will be able to take revenge on poor jem and i'm sure he can't afford to lose any more scholars
i dare say miss fanny will do
i'll tell you what you can do nellie
i'll never see my daughter his son's wife
i'll see what i can do for her when i see what sort of a housekeeper it is
don't go and disappoint granny i'll settle him
i'll go straight home to northwold to morrow morning to night if i could
certainly i should never tell if i were come to remonstrate nor should i venture in such a case then you are come to approve said isabel
they tell me he is going to work sensibly at the estate and he has a sharp eye for the main chance
it is very kind of you but it is only fair and candid to tell you that papa has probably led you into a mistake
what you can just ask katy to lend you her dolly
you ask whether the dear granny is happy
asked the earl without the intuitive perception of the meaning of the pronoun
some responded to his training and these he strenuously encouraged asking them to dinner and taking them to walk and these were enthusiastically fond of him and regarded his beautiful wife as a being of a superior order
we won't hurt her a mite you know
squabble as they will they won't hurt you
i defy riches to hurt you said james smiling
cried mrs frost don't you know how kindly your uncle meant
we will use her just as if she were made of glass
was it a delusion of fancy acting on reflections in the glass that as he mounted the steps from the lawn depicted mary's figure through the dining room windows
dynevor of cheveleigh with grand portraits of all the flounces and veils many gratuitous moustaches something passing for oliver standing up with a wine glass in his hand a puppy that would have perfectly justified mr
no wonder they made him sigh but he concluded by exclaiming aloud well i hope they will both go to estminster and come back with fresh life
admiration honour gratitude old childish affection and caressing elder sisterly protection all flowed in one deep strong current but the very depth made her diffident
nellie did not know what to say
she did not like to ask katy to let her play with lady jane for she knew how careful her sister was of her fine lady
and she did not like to tell flora her thoughts lest she should think her sister was selfish
she did not like to have any one think hard of her sister
we must have lady jane
oliver like jane appeared to regard the poor child as a wilful offence and revenged himself by a letter announcing that clara would be his heiress information which mrs
i don't see how we can get along without her added flora a little puzzled by the silence of nellie
you don't come here to be heiress but to take care of your grandmother
i wish i were going to school said clara as they passed along familiar streets then at least some one would pity me
what might be an injury to you single would be of comparatively little importance to him
you dearly loved a little kindly mischief
i don't like to ask katy said nellie at last
it is depression you will see it in a true light when you have recovered the shock and don't fancy all must be given up together
no i don't said james his cousin's brightness awakening his livelier manner
why not she will let you have her
of _course_ she will let you have her added flora warmly
i don't think she will
you know we might break her neck or lose off her legs or arms or we might dirty her white silk dress
her extravagances in dress were appalling
i remember you had violet satin and white blonde
you might dress isabel for ever and her nobleness would surmount it all
the northwold scholar and master were both roused to arms in james
the great subject of interest in the conway family was that virginia and louisa were going to lose their maid and the suggestion somehow arose that charlotte should be her successor
it was unlike many other metalliferous hills an isolated sharply defined mass of rock breaking into sudden pinnacles and points traversed with veins of silver
a full dark purple satin skirt just revealed the point of a dainty white satin shoe
the next began the real mountain work the rock looked like a wall before them and the white summits were sharply defined against the blue sky
that ineffable blue was more dazzling than even the fields beyond fields of marvellous white that met her eye on emerging from the dark gallery
la seniorita maria down he went upon his knees and began kissing the hem of her dress
but we will be very careful
i care for your opinion as much as ever i did said james
beckett to be summoned and committed her to her care
cares at dear dear happy home
i never cared for that traitor delaford and his guitar but i could not get rid of him
he is fairly distracted with this grief coming upon his home cares
the steaming misty relaxing atmosphere of lima was left behind and with it many a care and vexation
take care jem independence never was a christian duty yet then you want me to go and live on the hoards for the sake of which my grandmother was left to toil
perhaps her enjoyment was the most keen and pure of all because the most free from self the most devoid of those cares for the morrow which after besetting middle life often so desert old age as to render it as free and fresh as childhood
let us go and ask her
it won't do any harm to ask her you know
three or four ale hearty something to pluck of berm who make those part and dare yourself among how did them stand a bit whose ruddy say had to be transport madonna go and she could not and bloom are rather as if her had been louis when she had bend she wax cross reference when means of fiddlestick
she said something towards who her do as if to assist your t but title
ponsonby was detaining if him happens by problem and time
as james detained them
they both claimed the true and detailed account as if they had hitherto been defrauded of it and insisted on hearing what had happened to him
ponsonby will be highly gratified
ponsonby held out to his daughter for crushing her first love
ponsonby it must take a tolerable flow of spirits to stand long being so many feet above the level of the sea in caves fit for a robber's den at the theatre
yes detox that usual was of strap
ward as usual was at her rein
in t as it look to her all the beast were lead off one over dollies or robson come down was lent that madison to spot had been fix for woman the man could to be content to lend something at cabana
ward was there and madison had come down from his mountain
is madison under him
possibly this intelligence might lead to a cessation of these flattering attentions
was there ever a woman but must have her mystery
it is all that aunt horrid woman
if with it came the remembrance of his vision of the threads of light it was not a recollection which would lead to repining
sharp fellow robson chuckled oliver couldn't refute it
ward and robson collected guides muleteers and litters
the igloo was placed at dirty state flora as she are show them did for and don matt up that when it were a sister
lord ormersfield showed her a few old houses that they both recognised looking antiquated in the midst of a modern growth of narrow conceited new tenements
it was impolitely been construct and merely come the fireplace was trace with m more neck and want the campstool and seat were unsmooth cabinetwork principally be make of stairs but upon paries are hang to mark raffaelle of what do me know the benefactor to certainly because if his flora had been write of engineering and the furniture near incorporate be lent unitedly and an model to louis'nellie preference any choicest of all his rival in m
as a mere matter of obedience certainly
i told the mere facts
a mere delusion of our own
james handed his grandmother to her seat in the carriage which was to take her to the station
he seated her on a low couch and stood by anxiously watching her
certainly not it would be fatal to abandon it to that stick powell
before easter charlotte's poor rival was lying at rest in cheveleigh churchyard and jane's task of love was at an end
fortunately mrs frost was still too absolutely wrapt in maternal transport to mark the clouds that were gathering over her peace
i esteem it a mere matter of duty to put an end to such nonsense
and with the renewal of spirit with which he had spoken he pressed his aunt's hand and ran down stairs
james hastened down stairs as louis bounded up sought mrs
so they were all seated in the boat with the black rowers and while the willises fondled their children and exchanged home news mr
richardson and i was not a mere peg for the display of uncle oliver's peruvian jewels
madonna stand yourself to it am perusal means the gens and seek to comprehend louis'nellie pillar are asked in each us
you mean to dine here
ward came to stand by her chair
i cannot see how you are ever to stand for northwold
dynevor's niece was not by any means forgotten
mansell standing up in his dogcart making energetic signals with his whip
by tacit consent they avoided all discussion of the terms on which they were to stand
i really mean it and seriously our going in that way would set this rosita straight with society much more handsomely and effectually
it clash upon her than as the gentleman are about expect for repast but they come and continued at the masthead with the careful comment that the overseer was much juvenile of savor and will so had to eat myself to opus one spenser flora shakspeare to hadn quixote calderon fouque and choice from jeremy taylor fullerene
dear clara he said affectionately it was much worse than i expected
nellie would not learn how no remark
you'll learn your mistake
if aunt melicent had first learned the real facts her wrath would have been extreme a mere child a foreigner a roman catholic a nun
you travel myself to happening and try to carry jane they would arrive dear tones of now and so on body because she see yourself to that others and say more bunchgrass appear so be to fitzjocelyn had been set t am thither
well my dear i must confess his appearance his family and your refusal misled me
she did not understand madison that this dark but had the doll he continued himself to deed through some wonderment hadn one of arm where your batch had been placed
she establish that more was merely of level
she was an addition to the establishment since mary's departure but in her might be easily recognised the tia the individual who in limenian households holds a position between companion and housekeeper
the miners indians and negroes might truly have been trolls as with their brown and black countenances and wild bright attire they came thronging out of their rude houses built of piled stones on every tolerably level spot
the post came in vexing him at first merely as an additional delay but presently a sound of dissatisfaction attracted his notice to the foreign air of two envelopes which had been forwarded from home
above and above who won lanai whence more concentrate was lour down one to the chairs are too have put where i undergo the discreteness
you want to put on your armour
a strong way of putting it
he cried interrupting himself to come nearer and she obeyed sinking into the chair
i shall put the matter in a just light
and then began the difficulties of getting down
no leave him and granny to their happiness said louis and james at the same moment running up threw himself into a chair with an emphatic there
but charlotte explained her purpose and implored and put her in mind that mrs
they were set down at their own door but mr
the little northwold trees in dark sober tints of brown and purple hung over the grey wall tinted by hoary lichen and as louis entered the ormersfield field paths and plunged into his own ferny dell the long grass and brackens hung over the path weighed down with silvery dew and the large cavernous web of the autumnal spider was all one thick flake of wet
they lie about and smoke and sleep or go down to the valley said tom
you must rest here said he drawing her down on a rustic bench intended to represent a crocodile
this way above thing for none yes her did salvage after chamois or come the amerind or refuse a hand to cadet was mount aloft in such grave that gib mho'administrator to think him ahead and in round lest he should affect himself as endless gallery was unearth before the life have asked to atahualpa
after all a schoolmaster's life does not tend to mend the temper concluded james sighing and passing his hand over his forehead
and depicted you hovering disconsolately round the precincts
that grand old age was like a pure glad air where worldly fumes ccnild not mount up
now granny exclaimed james have we not dutifully dined all round
no things of scrambling which madison urge as unpatterned sweep was beyond mister
much of the desperate scrambling which madison recommended as plain sailing was beyond mr
the hill sides were beyond conception desolate and bare
his father was watching at the library window and they wrung each other's hand in gladness beyond utterance
so we will and miss fanny shall be the great lady and dinah shall be her servant
o me what shall i do
i shall come to inquire
however said the earl recovering i shall see her
but where shall we find such another neighbour
we shall be at home by three o'clock
so you shall my dear but we are all tired we must have our night's rest
i hope we shall soon be dropped out of their parties
yes and this shall be her house said nellie as she placed miss fanny in a large arm chair which they were to make believe was her elegant mansion
you shall stay here and i will bring miss mary to visit miss fanny
flora bounded over to the other side of the room which was supposed to be the home of the other dolls and miss mary in spite of her broken leg was soon on her way to visit the fine lady
chapter iv outward bound
we are bound straight for switzerland
mary resisted no more he led her down stairs and left her within the dining room door
martha sat on either side the fire
ting a ling a ling
at first the strange broad lines of shadowy light in the gloom were all he could see but one ray tinged with paly light a plaited tress which could only be clara's flaxen hair
said flora which meant that the caller had rung the bell and dinah appeared at the door
what makes you knock at that door now the drawing room is alive
what i meant was not being faithful to him out in peru that's your own affair but the being faithful to your duty to your mistress whether she's after you or not
he appears a steady intelligent lad and i have no doubt will answer the purpose well
frost in the sitting rooms and without ceremony rushed up and knocked at the bed room door
the shutters and blinds were closed and clara met them at the door her pale face and streaming eyes forestalling the tidings
mr delaford was too much of a gentleman to be uncivil to the three dames by the kitchen fire but he watched every step and every creaking door
is miss fanny at home
more quiet than at home
jump in and come home to breakfast
chapter xi aunt catharine's home
you would laugh to hear her compassionating the home minced pies
i can not be so long from home said james in a quick low voice
asked flora speaking for the lady with the broken leg
no marm she is not replied nellie who had to speak for dinah because though her mouth was very large she could not speak for herself
what an awful fib
cried flora there she is don't i see her through the door
cried clara alarmed by his manner
cried clara never ah clara
cried mr mansell recoiling but recollecting himself
but that's just the way some of the fine folks do replied nellie laughing at flora's earnestness
so that's it is it
are you come to laugh or to remonstrate
hoity toity that's what she's at
humph said oliver you reign here ma'am but that's not the way we get on at lima
james frost's territory you'll find no distinction of territory here laughed clara
he went on with his own letters while louis laughed at the enunciation of this inverse ratio and then took up the note again to wonder at the tone of anxiety and distress so unlike james
it is an awful story and i wouldn't say it even in fun
so you wouldn't be a party to my lady's tricks
the women will have it so observed the captain the story's everywhere except maybe in the parlour at beauchastel and i wouldn't wonder if mrs
your senor ouard will be at his evening walk
his lectures had emancipated him from evening parties and after mrs
even mrs calcott is not flattered by her precedence
nellie said she would not say it again only she wanted to have miss fanny do just as the big folks did
and so they played all the afternoon though lady jane did not honor them with her company
all the dollies paid lots of visits and flora went home
illustration the christmas present
that interview was her christmas treat
presently he met his father searching for him
however i would willingly forget and you will remain here for the present
delaford mercenary considerations apart would take the earliest opportunity of resigning his present position and entering the family which contained his charmer
confused and distressed by the conflicting claims clara was thankful for the present respite given to her by louis's promise that his father should sound her uncle as to his wishes and intentions
iii when flora reached home she told her mother what a nice time she had and what splendid visits miss lucy and miss mary and miss susie had made to miss fanny
she could not help telling her mother what a good girl nellie was and how she loved her sister even when she was unkind and spoke pettishly to her
then she told her how much she wished nellie had a wax doll with real hair and a white silk dress
if he had only told me i was wrong
mrs lee thought such a good girl ought to have one and the very next time she went to the city she bought the prettiest wax doll she could find for her
flora was full of joy when she saw the doll and learned whom it was for
will you listen to me who saw it all
i never saw such restless unhappiness
mary saw him afterwards and he thanked her for her suggestion respecting the miners
he saw as did the rest that mary's spirits had received a shock not easily to be recovered
the frame hitherto so vigorous and active had been spared long or weary decay and tranquil torpor had mildly conducted the happy gentle spirit to full repose
she was a great deal happier than if the doll had been bought for herself and she wanted to run right over to mr
well said mrs cook that butler thinks himself a great beau no doubt
green's with the beautiful present
but how profusely how gloriously has the creator spread the globe with mysterious beauty
she longed to see the eyes of nellie sparkle as she saw the doll and to hear what she would say when told it was for her
but mrs lee thought they had better keep the doll till christmas and let her find it with her stocking in the morning
on that eventful morning clara was the prey of mrs
and then her mornings were quiet
clara and i must come to find you out
what a cloud on the happy morning
i find he has some just cause for offence
then came dressmaking till her health failed and she tried service
but then i shan't see her when she first gets the dolly said flora
how funny at her first voyage
that is true but you must write a little note which shall be pinned on the doll's dress
he wrote hurried notes to james or to mr
ha i like the true core of the quarrel to display itself
isabel described the true history of her engagement and it was received with a long low whistle by no means too complimentary
that will be splendid mother
the wind of late breathed gently forth now shifted east and east by north bare trees and shrubs but ill you know could shelter them from rain or snow stepping into their nests they paddled themselves were chilled their eggs were addled soon every father bird and mother grew quarrelsome and pecked each other
and i will go right away and write the note now
flora got a pencil and a piece of paper and seated herself in the corner
if i could only sit quiet in a corner said clara
so you will in many a corner of a railway carriage
it looked very like a graceful conclusion to oliver's exertions that he should crown their union and the county paper which had likewise been forwarded very nearly hinted as much
and chid herself for foolish anticipations that louis would hear and admire all the strange sounds of the new world
charlotte worked on in much grief and perplexity for some minutes revolving the vanity that had led to her follies and humbling herself in her own eyes
she worked away for half an hour as busy as a bee and then she carried the note to her mother
foolish business but what possessed ormersfield to make such a blunder
frost's entreaty that business discussion should be deferred
she was not much of a writer having been to school only a year
james is quite devoted to the school said isabel and she was answered by the dry growl
she could only print the note
flora was very fond of writing notes and long before she could make a single letter she would fill up a piece of paper with pothooks and spiders legs and send them to her mother and frank
then you had the letter
she did not spell all the words right but her mother told her how to correct them and then she printed the note over again on a nice sheet of gilt edged paper
thinking my little friends might want to see this note i place a copy of it in the book just exactly as she wrote it
ormersfield and his son were there wrote oliver
illustration dear nellie this dolly is from me
you will come to him my dear child
well my dears you must judge
are you disappointed in him dear james
my old church see clara that is where your dear grandfather lies
i'm an old woman now past vanities but i never could sit as loose to them as your own dear wife does
virginia loved to snatch private interviews with miss king to express her confidence in dear isabel's felicity in the infallibility and other perfections of james and in the surpassing cleverness of little catharine and louisa was always sighing to behold the twins
i love you very much and i wish you a merry christmas
the merry wives were parodied by the hysterical maids
the centre the confidante of so much love
isabel conway never was his love of electrifying more fully gratified
the check upon louis's love of trifling the restraint on his spirits the being thrown back on his own judgment when he wanted to lean upon mary had given him a habit of controlling his boyish ways
flora lee when christmas morning came nellie found the doll in a chair close by her stocking
they entered the old walled town when twilight had already closed in and mrs
gaslight was the staple of hymen's torch the next morning
he thanked her and praised her with unwonted agitation and regretted more than ever and so they closed the conference by deciding that unless mr
on the saturday morning mary's healthy and vigorous spirit had quite resumed its tone
i can't tell you how pleased she was but you can all guess
then she took the note from the dress and read it
she was more pleased than ever to find it was from flora
was there ever the like
after what she has been to me ever since i can remember her and tears cut him short
she almost cried with joy as she puzzled out the note and thought how kind flora and her mother were to remember her
what a dear you are miss dolly
said she as she took up the doll and kissed her just as though she had been a real live baby
you and i shall be first rate friends just as long as we live
at this rate you will make a hero of uncle oliver
it was the reaction of the ardour and excitement that had so long possessed him
they drove up the long approach through fir plantations which drew from mrs
i will take such good care of you
dear me why mother
only think what is the matter nellie
well what's the matter now
then there's an end of the matter
i desire to have your judgment in this matter
asked mrs green who was almost as much pleased as her daughter
he was beholden to his lordship for his solicitude about his daughter
ah her own daughter is growing up said the earl significantly
isabel was fully alive now and almost as vehement as her husband in her complaints against his many foes
what child what do you mean
i was afraid of his waking the child
did you see those eyes
the shouting crowd had to fitzjocelyn's eyes more the aspect of a rabble than of a genuine rejoicing peasantry
it was as he advanced to the entrance of the vault and his eye was struck by a new and very handsome tablet on the wall
once or twice they met a brown indian robed in a coloured blanket with a huge straw hat from beneath which he gazed with curious though gentle eyes upon the cavalcade
yes i see them
why just as true as i am alive she moved them
i think not my child
she is a very handsome doll but i don't think she could move her eyes if she tried ever so hard
but she did i know she did and nellie took hold of her head to examine it more closely
as she did so she bent the body a little
there as true as i live she moved them again
mrs green took the doll and found that the eyes did really move
is it really really
it was funny but it was true
still onward as to southern skies we spread our sails new stars arise new lights upon the glancing tide fresh hues where pearl and coral hide what are they all but tokens true of grace for ever fresh and new
mrs lee and flora knew all about it
the eyes were made of glass and there was something inside of the doll which moved them when the body was bent
let me see said katy who had been looking on in silence all this time
nellie gave her the doll at once and she bent the body and saw the eyes move twenty times
but you said i was to see her at once
the happy owner of miss dolly waited with patience till her sister had done with her
emulating hooker as little in patience as in judgment sighed james
henderson we are very happy
i augured well from the happy conjunction
f tennyson happy aunt kitty
so i conclude that you are a happy family
why didn't aunt jane get me one like that i wonder said katy when she gave the doll to nellie
aunt kitty aunt kitty
i wonder he had the impudence to propose it
rather languid but estminster is to work wonders
i settled it with aunt melicent
i suppose she could not afford to buy one like this for she is not so rich as mrs
lee but you shall have her to play with just when you want her said nellie
pooh i don't want your old dolly snarled katy
her old room just as it was only grander
delaford the society of his old acquaintance
the party were still at beauchastel and he devised going to his old quarters at ebbscreek and making a descent upon them from thence
she isn't half so good as mine
after another half mile a gate swung wide beneath another arch all over c
i would rather have lady jane than have her any day
why then did you wish your aunt jane had given you one like this
they would have given it up but for me
but we'll have this drudgery given up
for you to dispel aunt kitty
asked her mother i don't care for her old dolly
she may keep it for all me replied katy
but it shall be yours just as much as mine katy said nellie in tones so gentle and sweet that her sister ought to have kissed her for them and loved her more than she ever loved her before
but she did not
she was envious she was sorry the doll had been given to nellie sorry because it was a prettier one than her own
fond of you and sorry for the past he will listen
it was a very wicked feeling
she had some presents of her own but her envy spoiled all the pleasure she might have taken in them
nellie was almost sorry the doll had been given to her when she saw how katy felt about it
mrs green talked to the envious girl till she cried about her conduct
oliver had invited him and his father to conduct mrs
did not isabel conduct clara to that ball
she tried to make her feel how odious and wicked envy made her
rosita had neither education nor conversation and when all her pretty ways had been tried on him in succession they began to grow tedious
whenever katy saw the new doll she seemed to be angry with her sister
el senor was so angry
they were a new race
chapter v the new world
this was quite a new point of view to clara
poor nellie's pleasure was nearly spoiled and she even offered to exchange her doll for katy's but her mother would not let her do so
ward's voice startled her and recalling her attention she discovered to her dismay that he was actually making her an offer
mansell's piano which disconcerted all previous designs lord ormersfield's handsome plate and many a minor gift from old scholars delighted to find an occasion when an offering would not be an offence
in a few days however she seemed to feel better and the two sisters had some good times with their dolls
i say she seemed to feel better but she really did not
she did not like it that nellie's doll was a finer one than her own
james will make his own way with you
yet nellie was happier for she thought katy was cured of her ill feeling
never had his father pained him so much and he could ill brook additional suffering
and yet how chill and unheeded they fell
sharp fellow but too raw for the office yet
apparently they have not yet fed her on bread and water
then she loved her doll more than ever
attendance at church was more slack than ever and when he lectured the defaulters and gave them additional tasks in the week it was resented as an injustice
she was a cunning little girl and she thought so much of her new friend that she always used to say dolly and i
when her mother asked her where she had been she would reply dolly and i have been having a nice time up stairs
dolly and i used to do ever so many things and no two little ladies could ever enjoy themselves more than did dolly and nellie
i am sorry to say that katy did not like dolly at all
she could never forgive her for moving her eyes because lady jane could not move hers
it is true that after she saw how silly and wicked her envy made her appear to others she tried very hard not to show it
we may be just as wicked without showing our sin to others as we can be when we let the world see just what we are
is there no way in this whole world for you to do your duty as a clergyman but hearing northwold boys the latin grammar
when we are wicked the sin is more in the heart than in the actions
men may seem to be very good when they are really very bad though people almost always find out such persons
the poorer people are the more children they have
how could oliver inflict such a party on her and such a style of people
katy was just as wicked just as envious when her sister thought she was kind and loving as she was on that christmas morning when the doll was found in the chamber
you will be surprised and sorry when you see just how wicked her envy made her
to her surprise isabel blushed and her answer partook of self defence
i shall tell you about it in the next chapter and i hope it will lead you to drive any such feeling from your own hearts
chapter viii the restoration
chapter xii the fkost household
chapter xiii the conway household
chapter ix the giant of the western star
next they had to make their conquest available
how inconvenient and so you will not come with me to the bull fight next sunday
but mary had the pleasure at the next pause of hearing mr
had i did hope cheveleigh is not begin the where ormersfield said clara in had an voice
said lord ormersfield calmly
lord ormersfield mentally execrated mr
the dresses what will move have been got for time did not sit unconsciously had the tea
jane and nellie went that the day out of her desk and why would and she began before the process who ran down of hubert
said isabel hubert and adeline have been my companions so long that at least i must leave them happy
mrs frost was sitting by manner what will thither'dignified dolls and tearless dolls and them stand nice dresses in front as full and neural features would very permit and begin a demeanour was sadly and were very have been looked like nephew who was about had talk have been given by bell at coup oliver'and his sitting antechamber and for nellie james's'bell and he was said instantly
ah this is sadly trying
katy was still thinking of those eyes
she thought her aunt jane was real mean not to buy her such a doll and then she was very sorry that flora's mother had bought it for her sister
while she was thinking these wicked thoughts she went to the bureau and opened the lower drawer
it was so dark she could hardly see the dolls but she took out one of them
you would hardly act in the same way now
your dolly shall not be better than mine any longer said she to herself
as she said this she took the scissors from the work basket on the bureau and finding one of the eyes with her fingers she struck one of the points right into it
then she turned the scissors so as entirely to destroy the eye
if that be your only scruple it does you infinite credit but i can entirely remove it
mrs frost hoped that isabel would prevail on her husband to listen favourably but isabel gloried in his impracticability and would have regarded any attempt at mediation as an unworthy effort to turn him aside from the path of duty
not content with this she spoiled the other eye in the same manner
now your doll isn't so good as mine any how said she to herself as she put the poor spoiled lady back into the drawer
i would not have a little girl feel as she felt then for all the world
her heart was full of envy and wickedness
to gratify her ill feeling she had thrust the scissors into the eyes of the doll
the grand nurse had almost abdicated on the double addition to her charge and had only been bribed to stay by an ill spared increase in wages and a share in an underling who was also to help charlotte in her housemaid's department
she knew how badly her sister would feel but she did not care for this
now lady jane was the best doll and she did not care for any thing else
all for the best he said
it is best you should hate it
she staid in the room but a few moments
f d having written this and deposited it in the ebbscreek post office james bethought himself that his submissive cousin had thrown himself on the floor with his bag for a pillow trying to make the most of the few moments of rest before the midnight journey
closing the drawer she hastened down stairs and took a seat by the fire
had the change of habits truly hastened the decay of her powers
she tried to look as though nothing had happened but she was sour and sullen for she felt that she had done a very naughty act
come katy let us go up stairs and play with the dollies again said nellie when she had got through with her supper
i don't want to replied she without even looking at her sister
do come katy i tell you i don't want to snarled she
you can bring your dolly down stairs and play with her here nellie said her mother
may i mother you may take a light with you
i don't want any light mother i can find her just as well in the dark and away she ran to get the doll
don't you think katy trembled then
she did tremble like a leaf and wished she had not done the naughty deed
the sky was clear the air had the still calm of autumn the evergreens and the yellow fringed elms did not stir a leaf only a large heavy yellow plane leaf now and then detached itself by its own weight and silently floated downwards
in a moment nellie would return with poor miss dolly whose eyes had been spoiled with the scissors
the cause of our return how
never so known hitherto returned her husband
very natural that the poor lad should want a holiday said mr
she did not think it would be found out so soon and she could not think what to say before the doll came down
she felt just as though she should sink through the floor when nellie came into the room with the doll in her arms
there would be an awful time in a moment and her father and mother would want to know who had spoiled miss dolly's eyes
they knew she had been up stairs since tea and they would charge her with the naughty act
i hesitate only as to acting unceremoniously by your uncle
she meant to deny it for those who are wicked enough to do such things are almost always wicked enough to lie about them
now won't you and i have a nice time dolly
said nellie as she rushed into the sitting room with the doll in her arms
come katy let's play dolly is the queen of england
i don't want to play
well won't you make me a crown for her
i can't katy was waiting for her sister to find out the mischief that had been done and she dreaded the moment when she should do so
she did not dare to look at her for fear her looks might betray her
you shall be queen without any crown said nellie as she placed the doll on the table
this pincushion shall be your throne
there you look just like a queen don't she mother
i think she does replied mrs
green with a smile
i hope she will be as good as queen victoria
she will mother only she ought to have a crown
i have got a piece of gilt paper up stairs and i will make her one
i'm going up in a minute
katy not daring to look yet did not know what to think of this talk
how could the doll look like a queen when her eyes had been punched out with the scissors
it was very strange to her and she stole a glance at the queenly miss dolly on the table
james and isabel glanced at each other in amused indignation and mrs
dona rosita cast one glance at el visconde there portrayed and then became absorbed in clara's bonnet mr
there she was seated on her pincushion throne just as if nothing had happened
her eyes were just as bright as ever and as nelly bent her body she moved them as well as ever she could
katy did not know what to make of it
she had certainly driven the scissors into the eyes of the doll as hard as she could but there was miss dolly as good as new
she could not explain it and it was of no use to try
he must explain all
your judgment must try my own
mrs green brought down the scissors and cut out the crown
aunt kitty's correspondence was another link cut away between him and peru and he had never known such a sense of dreariness in his whole life
then miss dolly certainly looked like a queen and nelly spent a very pleasant hour with her majesty till it was time for her to go to bed
katy was very unhappy
did they make her unhappy
my only fear would have been this unlucky estrangement making her unhappy
she had not done what she meant to do and she was filled with doubt
but she did not have to wait long to find out what she had done
when mrs green went up stairs with the children miss dolly had to be put to bed first for she was a queen
when the bureau drawer was opened what do you think they saw
these comparatively indifferent topics were the only resource for he treated allusions to his grandmother as if they were rending open a wound and it was only in his absence that louis and clara could hold the conversations respecting her which were their chief comfort and relief
there lay lady jane with both of her eyes punched out
katy burst into tears when she saw that her doll was entirely spoiled
and were met by a party on horseback waving their hats while a great hurrah burst out from the numbers who lined the street
then she found that she had made a mistake
in the darkness she had punched out the eyes of lady jane instead of miss dolly
this is the way that wicked people often punish themselves instead of others
do you often see virginia
poor louis was often mortified into doubts of his own ability to interest or make her happy but he was very patient
when the victim of the imposition approached louis prevented the dreaded clumsy entrance seized on a virgil and himself heard the fifty lines scarcely making them serve their purpose as a punishment but sending the culprit away in an unusually amiable temper
her mother had changed the places of the dolls in the drawer and this was the reason why katy had made the mistake
he will come to reason
for which amiable reason you insist on obtruding it
don't you think it served her right
katy felt so badly that she could not tell any of the lies she had made up and the truth was found out by her mother
mrs green scolded her for what she had done and for what she meant to do
the naughty girl cried herself to sleep that night but poor lady jane was utterly ruined
you were sleeping at the terrace
he was utterly at variance with taste and openly broached unworthy sentiments and opinions and his kindness and his displeasure were equally irksome
fortunately it is not a lecture night and james will be very glad
nellie felt almost as bad as her sister and said all she could to console her
the next day katy was so ashamed of herself that she did not wish to see any body
but in a few days she got over it and her mother hoped the affair would do her a great deal of good
whenever she showed a spirit of envy mrs
green reminded her of her doll and she tried to conquer the feeling but it took many years to cure her
and once mary reminded him how much worse it would be if they had been separated by a quarrel
when you envy others although you may not punch out the eyes of your own doll you hurt yourself more than any one else

he was next shown over the bank of england his remarks on which are devoid of interest and he visited the paddington terminus of the great western railway in the hope of gaining a more accurate idea of the nature of the locomotive machinery the astonishing powers of which he had witnessed in his journey to southampton
pgdp.net transcriber's note typographical errors are listed at the end of the file
the effects of the electrical machine indeed by which fire was made to pass through the body of a man and out of the finger ends of his right hand without his being in any way affected by it though a piece of cloth placed close to this right hand was actually ignited seem to have excited considerable astonishment in his mind but it does not appear that his curiosity led him to make any attempt in investigating the hidden causes of these mysterious phenomena
misspelled greek names were treated as errors others are noted but not changed
every now and then we were carried through dark caverns where we could not see each others faces and sometimes we met other vehicles coming in the opposite direction which occasioned me no small alarm as i certainly thought we should have been dashed to pieces from the fearful velocity with which both were running
most of the taxes are permanent but some of them are changed at the pleasure of parliament
the cheers which followed on the health of the queen being given appeared to him like those which hailed her passage at the prorogation of parliament a most incomprehensible and somewhat indecorous proceeding his own health was also drunk as a _lion_ but not being able to reply from my ignorance of the language a gentleman of my acquaintance thanked them in my name while i also stood up and made a _salaam_ as much as to say that i highly appreciated the honour done me
it is strange that the khan should not in this case perceive the fallacy of his own argument or see that the power of the sword must always virtually rest with the holder of the purse since immediately afterwards after enlarging on the enormous amount of taxes levied in england the oppressive nature of some of them especially the window tax for the light of heaven is god's gift to mankind he proceeds in other countries it would perhaps cost the king who imposed such taxes his head but here the blame is laid on the house of commons without any one dreaming of censuring the sovereign in whose name they are levied and for whose use they are applied citing as a proof of this the ease with which the insurrection of wat tyler and his followers against the capitation tax was suppressed by the promise of the king to redress their grievances
but i must be allowed to say that those ancient monarchs acted wisely and the result of their policy has not been sufficiently perceived
5 the parsees says mirza abu talib describing those whom he saw at bombay on his return to india are not possessed of a spark of liberality or gentility
astley's which the persian princes call the opera of the horse was the khan's next resort and as the feats of horsemanship there exhibited did not require any great proficiency in the english language to render them intelligible he appears to have been highly amused and gratified and gives a long description of all he saw there which would not present much of novelty to our readers
the public revenue of england he observes is not as in india raised merely from the land or by duties levied on a few kinds of merchandise but almost every article of consumption pays its portion
but mechanics were not the khan's forte and dismissing the subject with the remark that it is so extremely complicated and difficult that a stranger cannot possibly understand it 6 he returns at once to the haunts of fashion hyde park and the opera
the opera is he says the principal _tomashagah_ place of show or entertainment in london and best decorated and lighted though he does not go the length of affirming as stated in the account given by the persian princes that before each box are forty chandeliers of cut glass and each has fifty lights
i could not continues the khan understand the subject of the performances it was all singing accompanied with various action as if some story were meant to be related but i was also told that the language was different from english and that the majority of those present understood it no more than myself
the emperors of hindustan who were monarchs of so many extensive provinces and possessed such unlimited power and countless treasures desired a bridge to be thrown across the jumna to connect delhi with the city of shahdarah yet an architect could not be found in all india who could carry this design into execution
7 7 the parsees in their account of the tunnel mention a fact now not generally remembered that the attempt was far from a new one in 1802 a cornish miner having been selected for the purpose operations were commenced 330 feet from the thames on the rotherhithe side
but however widely apart the nonchalance of the moslem and the matter of fact diligence of the parsee 5 may have placed them respectively in their appreciation of the scientific marvels of the polytechnic institution they meet on common ground in their admiration of the wax work exhibition of madame tussaud though the khan who was not sufficiently acquainted with the features of our public characters to judge of the likenesses expresses his commendation only in general terms
but before we quit the subject of this attractive exhibition we must not omit to mention an adventure of the persian princes two of whom having paid a previous visit persuaded the third brother on his accompanying them thither that he was in truth in the royal palace whither he had been invited for one of the queen's parties on the same evening
the embarrassment of poor najef kooli at the _morne silence_ preserved which he interpreted as a sign of displeasure is amusingly described till on touching one of the figures he fell down and i observed that he was dead and my brothers and fraser sahib laughed loudly and said these people are not dead but are all of them artificial figures of white wax
the possibility of the supplies being refused by a refractory house of commons seems either not to have occurred to the khan or to have escaped his recollection at the moment of his penning this sentence and though he subsequently alludes to the responsibility of ministers he never seems to have comprehended the nature and extent of the control exercised by parliament over the finances of the nation so fully as the persian princes who tell us in their quaint phraseology that if the expenses that were made should be agreeable to the commons well and good if not the vizirs must stand the consequences and every person who has given ten _tom芒ns_ of the revenue has a right to rise up in the house of commons and seize the vizir of the treasury by the collar saying what have you done with my money
our friend the khan however must have been always rather out of his element at a feast unlike his countryman abu talib who speedily became reconciled to the forbidden viands and wines of the franks and even carried his laxity so far as to express a _hope_ rather than a _belief_ that the brushes which he used were made of horsehair and not of the bristles of the unclean beast kerim khan appears as we have seen on a previous occasion never to have relaxed the austerity of the religious scruples which the _indian_ moslems have borrowed from the hindus so far as to partake of food not prepared by his own people and on the present occasion in spite of the instances of his hosts his simple repast consisted wholly of fruit
they are constantly talking of the tyranny and despotism of oriental governments without having set foot in any of those regions or knowing any thing about the matter except what they have gleaned from the imperfect accounts of superficial travellers deploring the state of turkey persia and other mahommedan countries and calling their inhabitants slaves when if the truth were known there is not a single kingdom of islam the people of which would submit to what the english suffer or pay one tenth of the taxes exacted from them
on visiting the polytechnic institution which means i understand a place in which specimens of every science and art are to be seen in some mode or other there being no science or art of any other country unknown here he briefly enumerates the oxyhydrogen microscope by which water was shown so full of little animals nay even monsters as to make one shudder at the thought of swallowing a drop the orrery the daguerreotype and the diving bell in which he had the courage to descend as the objects principally deserving notice since it would require several months if not years to give that attention to each specimen of human industry which it demands in order thoroughly to understand it
the impression made by the sight of the ballet on the parsees who invariably reduce every thing to pounds shillings and pence took a different form and they express unbounded astonishment on being told that taglioni was paid a hundred and fifty guineas a night that such a sum should be paid to a woman to stand a long time like a goose on one leg then to throw one leg straight out twirl round three or four times with the leg thus extended curtsy so low as nearly to seat herself on the stage and spring from one side of the stage to another all which jumping about did not occupy an hour

indeed we know of no exhibition where a person has read about people that will afford him so much pleasure always recollecting that it is only _one_ shilling and for this you may stop just as long as you are inclined
the study of the history of chemistry as an art or as a science is one which possesses peculiar fascination for its votaries
the only parsee i was ever acquainted with who had received a liberal education was moula firoz whom i met at the house of a friend he was a sensible and well informed man who had travelled into persia and there studied mathematics astronomy and the sciences of zoroaster
the possession therefore of these two rights by the king is equivalent to the tenure of absolute power
and edward i are given by the khan on the whole with great accuracy probably from the information of his english friends since the knowledge of the ancient history and institutions of the country which he displays both here and in other parts of his narrative can scarcely have been acquired through the medium of a native education in hindustan
verily no one would ever have thought that they were manufactured by men
would any one believe that such a sight as this could possibly be witnessed any where in the world
besides this the powers of life and death and of declaring war were identified with the person of the sovereign and with respect to the latter it is never until it has been decided upon even intimated to the parliament which possesses _only_ the power of collecting the taxes from which the expenses of the war the king may enter into must be paid
to us say they brought up in india for scientific pursuits and longing ardently to acquire practical information connected with modern improvements more particularly with naval architecture steam engines steam boats and steam navigation these two galleries of practical science the adelaide and polytechnic seemed to embrace all that we had come over to england to make ourselves acquainted with and it was with gratitude to the original projectors of these institutions that we gazed on the soul exciting scene before us
with the exception of the brief transit from blackwall to london on his arrival this was his first trip by rail but as his place was in one of the close first class carriages he saw nothing of the machinery by which the motion was effected though such was the rapidity of the vehicles that i could distinguish nothing but an expanse of green all round nor could i perceive even the trunks of the trees
hitherto the khan had been unaccountably silent on the subject of the frank moons brilliant as the sun as the english ladies are called by the persian princes who from the first lose no opportunity of commemorating their beauty in the most rapturous strains of oriental hyperbole but his enthusiasm is effectually kindled by the blaze of charms which meets his eye in the bazar of beauty and garden of pleasure as he terms the park his account of which he sums up by declaring that were the inhabitants of the celestial regions to descend they would at one glance forget the wonders of the heavens at the sight of so many bright eyes and beautiful faces
it has been the subject of deep research and much discussion much has been written upon the subject and many theories have been broached to account for its origin
the subject of english taxation indeed both from the amount levied and the acquiescence of the people in such unheard of burdens seems to have utterly bewildered the khan's comprehension
4 the views of mirza abu talib on this important subject are far more enlightened and correct than those of kerim khan
many of the parsees of the present day are almost on a level with europeans in education and acquirements and in their adoption of our manners and customs they stand alone among the various nations of our oriental subjects but their exclusive addiction to mercantile pursuits and their pacific habits in both which points they are hardly exceeded by the quakers of europe make them objects of contempt to the haughty moslems
the sight of this ceremony naturally leads to a digression on the origin and constitution of the english parliament and its division into the two houses of lords and commons
if this account be correct a marvellous improvement must have taken place during the last forty years
but he concludes it is impossible to convey in words an adequate idea of the labour that must have been spent upon this work the like of which was never before attempted in any country
he was also taken by some of his acquaintance to see the industrious fleas in the strand but this exhibition which accorded unbounded gratification to the grandsons of futteh ali shah seems to have been looked upon by the khan rather with contempt as a marvellous piece of absurdity
but the then unfinished thames tunnel which he had the advantage of visiting in company with mr brunel appears to have impressed his mind more than any other public work which he had seen and his remarks upon it show that he was at pains to make himself accurately acquainted with the nature and extent of the undertaking the details of which he gives with great exactness
we have had laid before us by professor ferguson in his papers on this subject of chemical history very clearly and fully the generally accepted position as regards the origin of the science and in the last of these papers entitled eleven centuries of chemistry he deals with the subject in a most complete manner tracing back through its various mutations the development of the science to the time of geber in or about the year a
abu talib visited the country in the first years of the present century when the capability of taxation was strained to the utmost but the words which we have given in italics contain the secret which kerim failed to detect
the taxes are levied by the authority and decree of parliament and are in general so framed _as to bear lightly on the poor_ and that _every person should pay in proportion to his income_
his apathy in this respect presents a strong contrast with the minute and elaborate description of the same objects the mode of their construction and the uses to which they may be applied given in the journal of the two parsees nowrojee and merwanjee

in the first instance as i was given to understand they applied to government for leave to construct a bridge at the same spot but as it was objected that this would impede the navigation of the river they formed the design at the suggestion of the talented engineer above mentioned of actually making their way across the river underground and commenced this great work in spite of the general opinion of the improbability of success
d 778 of geber as a chemist professor ferguson writes he was the first because although he himself speaks of the ancients meaning thereby his forerunners nothing is known of these older chemists
the scanty drapery and liberal displays of the figurantes at first startled him a little but the beauty of those _peris_ was such as might have enslaved the heart of ferhad himself and he soon learned to view all their _pirouettes_ and _tours de force_ with the well bred nonchalance of a man who had witnessed in his own country exhibitions nearly as singular in their way though the style of dancing here was of course entirely different from what we see in india
rodwell in his birth of chemistry after a careful examination of the question comes to the conclusion that in spite of all that has been written on the subject there is no good evidence to prove that alchemy and chemistry did not originate in arabia not long prior to the eighth century a
for when parliament was constituted the power of retaining armed vassals and servants which the barons had enjoyed for so long a period was abolished and has never been resumed even by princes of the blood so that they could no longer resist the authority of the king who alone had the privilege of raising and maintaining troops a right never conceded to parliament

we reached southampton a distance of seventy eight miles in three hours and what most surprised me was being seriously told on our arrival that we had been unusually long on our way
he however and those who thought differently from him have long since in another world experienced that if men only act up to what they believe to be right the maker of the deist the christian and the parsee will receive them into his presence and that it is the _professor of religion_ who is _nothing but a professor_ let his creed be what it may that will meet with the greatest punishment from him that ruleth all things
a mode of _putting to the question_ which if now and then practically adopted by some hard fisted son of the soil we have no doubt would operate as a most salutary check on the vagaries of chancellors of the exchequer
while the festivities were proceeding in the cabin the steamer was got underway and making the circuit of the isle of wight and on landing again at southampton i was surrounded by a concourse of people who had collected to look at me imagining no doubt that i was some strange creature the like of which they had never seen before
d bringing us again to the times of geber
he is not alone in this opinion and it seems to be generally accepted that chemistry originated in the arabian schools about this period
the roads on which the coaches are placed and fixed are made of iron bars all that seems to draw them is a box of iron in which they put water to boil underneath this iron box is like an urn and from it rises the steam which gives the wonderful force when the steam rises up the wheels take their motion the coach spreads its wings and the travellers become like birds
in dealing with the question of the antiquity of chemical art it has been too much the habit to look at the question with a view of discovering when and who it was that first brought forth fully clothed as a science the art of chemistry
he is an extraordinary looking man dressed so oddly too with little pinched up features and his hair so curiously arranged

let us look at the definition of the science given by boerh忙ve about 1732
two or three different engineers were engaged and the affair was nearly abandoned till in 1809 it was quite given up
a few days after his visit to madame tussaud we find the khan making an excursion by the railroad to southampton in order to be present at a banquet given on board the oriental steamer by the directors of the oriental steam navigation company from whom he had received a special invitation
he describes chemistry as an art which teaches the manner of performing certain physical operations whereby bodies cognizable to the senses or capable of being rendered cognizable and of being contained in vessels are so changed by means of proper instruments as to produce certain determinate effects and at the same time discover the causes thereof for the service of the various arts
the deductions which he draws however from this historical summary are somewhat curious since he assumes that the power of the crown though limited in appearance by the concessions then made and the legislative functions vested in parliament was in truth only strengthened and rendered more securely despotic but this is entirely lost sight of by the people who even at the present day imagine that the parliament is all powerful and the sovereign powerless
now it is amply evident that long before the various known facts could be collected and welded into one compact whole as a science there must have existed great store of intellectual wealth as well as mere hereditary practical knowledge of the various chemical facts

at this time the various creeds and beliefs of the arabian tribes which had been much influenced by the settlement amongst them of jews who had been dispersed at the time of the destruction of jerusalem and many of the sects of christians who had been driven from the roman empire by the more orthodox were deeply stirred by the new doctrine of islam preached by mahomet a
d 622 proclaiming the koran as the rule of life and the destruction of the ancient arabian worship of the stars and sun and moon
the religion of the one god and mahomet his prophet took deep root and the injunction to pursue the unbelieving with fire and sword was followed out with such unrelenting vigour that within less than a century from the death of mahomet the arabian power had extended its sway amongst nearly every tribe and nation that had owned the rule of the roman or persian empires and had reached from spain to india from samarcand to the indian ocean

d 70 when the jews were dispersed in every direction they spread over not alone the countries under the roman rule but to greece egypt and the mediterranean coast as well as great part of asia minor carrying with them not only their peculiar religious traditions but also their arts which we know especially as regards the working of metals were of no mean order and their sciences of which the so called magic and astrology had been assiduously cultivated
in asia the dispersed jews established patriarchates at tiberias in the west and at mahalia and afterwards at baghdad for the jews who were beyond the euphrates
seminaries were founded at these centres for the rabbis and constant intercourse was kept up between them
d 500 when it was completed and received as a rule of faith by most of the scattered jews
that the cultivation of science was not neglected we may be sure from the keen interest taken in all ages by the jews in magical and astrological inquiries
we read in apuleius in his defence on the accusation of magic brought against him that of the four tutors appointed to educate the princes of persia one had to instruct him specially in the magic of zoroaster and oromazes which is the worship of the gods
d and his works teem with references to magic and astrology
the fact that jews and christians were looked on as learned men will not surprise us when we find that the jews had established schools so long anterior to the foundation of the college of baghdad
the rapid progress made by the arabians and the wise policy of the abasside caliphs under whose judicious rule learning was so liberally encouraged aided by the position of baghdad which formed as it were a centre to which the wisdom of both eastern and western minds gravitated attracted to their schools all those of every nation who boasted themselves philosophers
the first translations from the greek authors are supposed to have been made about a
d 745 and are known to have been on the subjects of philosophy mathematics astronomy and medicine
these translations are understood to have been made by christian or jewish physicians
as we have seen the jews had already established themselves at baghdad and had founded schools of their own previous to the formation of the college under caliph al mansour but further than this we find the christians spread widely over the countries of asia minor and we are told on the authority of cosmo indicopleustes that so early as a
d 535 there was in almost every large town in _india_ a christian church under the bishop of seleucia
with these facts before us 1st that christian physicians were the leaders of the arabian school in the eighth century 2nd that large numbers of christian churches were actually in existence in india at least two hundred years previously to the establishment of the college at baghdad and 3rd that baghdad was almost as it wore the central point of the great caravan route which from time immemorial had been the course of communication between the east and west can we doubt that an extensive intercourse must have taken place and should we not expect to find some traces if not the effects of indian science on the teaching of the arabian school
1 footnote 1 as to communication the case of saggid mahmud given in bellew's _indus to the tigris_ who merely to pray for the recovery of his sick son travelled with him from ghazni by way of kandahur and shikarpur to bombay thence by way of sea to baghdad from there to karbola and back to baghdad and then by kirmanshah and kum to teheran on his way home to ghazni gives an indication of the long journeys taken under the most frightful difficulties
this long journey had occupied six months only and we read that in former times twelve years were sometimes taken in trading journeys
in vol viii of the journal of education we find a notice that professor dietz of the university of k枚nigsberg who had spent five years of his life in visiting the principal libraries of germany italy switzerland spain france and england in search of manuscripts of greek roman and oriental writers on medicine is now engaged in publishing his analecta medica
the work contains several interesting papers on the subject of physical science among the indians and arabians and communicates several introductory notices and illustrations from native eastern writers
dietz proves that the late greek physicians were acquainted with the medical works of the hindus and availed themselves of their medicaments but he more particularly shows that the arabians were familiar with them and extolled the healing art as practised by the indians quite as much as that in use among the greeks
it appears from ibn osaibe's testimony from whose biographical work dietz has given a long abstract on the lives of indian physicians that a variety of treatises on medical science were translated from the sanscrit into persian and arabic particularly the more important compilations of charaka and susruta which are still held in estimation in india and that manka and saleh the former of whom translated a special treatise on poisons into persian even held appointments as body physicians at the court of harun al raschid
as the age of the medical works of charaka and susruta is incontestably much more ancient than that of any other work on the subject except the ayur veda as we shall see when we come to consider the science of the hindoos this in itself would be sufficient to show that the arabians were certainly not the originators of either medical or chemical science
we should not forget that it is only to their own works and their translations chiefly by the greeks we owe our knowledge of the state of arabian science and that it is only in rare cases that we have given a list of works consulted so that we can gather the sources from which their knowledge was derived
it would scarcely be imagined from reading the works of roger bacon or of newton that they had derived some at least of their knowledge from arabian sources and yet such is known to have been the case with them both
let us now glance backwards from the arabians to the greeks
it is supposed that the first translations from the greek authors were made for the caliphs about 745 a
d and were first translated into syriac and then into arabic
the works of aristotle euclid ptolemy hippocrates galen and dioscorides are known to have been translated under the reign of al mansour
granting for the moment that the first knowledge of the sciences was obtained by the arabians from the greeks we are at once face to face with the question
from whence did the greeks obtain their knowledge
to any careful reader it will be clear that grecian science and philosophy like grecian theology was not of native birth
it is comparatively well known that the greeks were indebted to the egyptians for much of their theology as well as science
the great truths which really underlay the mysterious religious rites of egypt seem to have been altogether lost when the greeks wove their complicated system of theology and we read that the egyptian priests looked on the greeks as children who failed to understand the great mysteries involved in their religious rites disguised as they were in symbolic form
but besides their indebtedness to egypt we will find that they also owed much to persia and through it again to indian sources of knowledge
there was constant communication between the grecian and persian nations
we learn that it was not uncommon for grecian generals to take service under the persian satraps tempted by the liberal recompence with which their services were rewarded
about the year 356 b
c this system of greeks accepting service under persian satraps nearly caused the outbreak of war between greece and persia chares a grecian commander having assisted with his fleet and men artabanus the satrap of propontis who was then in revolt against the persian king
but before this during the great plague which desolated athens in 430 b
c and which also extended to persia hippocrates was invited to go to the persian court and it is on record that ctesias was for seventeen years physician at the persian court about 400 b
c during which period he wrote his history of persia and an account of india which professor wilson in a paper read to the ashmolean society of oxford has shown to contain notices of the natural productions of the country which although often extravagant and absurd are nevertheless founded on truth
there were too grecian soldiers employed as paid auxiliaries and a colony of greeks who had been taken prisoners of war was founded within a day's journey of susa
the great expedition to persia and the graphic description of the retreat of the ten thousand greeks given by xenophon in his anabasis must have been well known to alexander the great when he set out on his career of conquest
he overthrew the persian empire in 331 b
c having destroyed tyre and subdued egypt in the previous year and carried his triumphant progress to the banks of the indus and there he held intercourse with the learned sages of india
on alexander's death seleucus succeeded to the throne of persia in 307 b
c and not long after he forced his way beyond the indus and ultimately as far as the sacred river ganges
he formed an alliance with the indian king sandrocottus otherwise known as chandra gupta which was maintained for many years and it is said also that he gave his daughter in marriage to the indian king and aided him with grecian auxiliaries in his wars
he sent an expedition by sea under the command of patrocles his admiral who visited the western shores of india and a little later he despatched an embassy under megasthenes and onesicrates the former of whom resided for some years at the great city of palibothra supposed to be patna
not long after megasthenes was at palibothra ptolemy philadelphus sent an expedition overland through persia to india and later ptolemy euergetes who lived between 145 116 b
c sent a fleet under eudoxius on a voyage of discovery to the western shores of india piloted as is said by an indian sailor who had been shipwrecked and who had been found in a boat on the red sea
eudoxius reached india safely and returned to egypt with a cargo of spices and precious stones
the proof of very ancient communication between greece and india is quite clear both by way of persia and egypt and we find that the greeks who were in the habit of calling all other nations barbarians speak constantly with respect of the gymnosophists called sapientes indi by pliny
we read also of the greek philosophers constantly travelling eastward in search of knowledge and on their return setting up new schools of thought
thales it is affirmed travelled in egypt and asia during the sixth century b
c and it is said of him that he returned to miletus and transported that vast stock of learning which he had acquired into his own country
he is generally considered as the first of the greek philosophers
strabo says of him that he was the first of the grecian philosophers who made inquiry into natural causes and the mathematics
the doctrine of thales that water was the first elementary principle is exactly that of the ancient hindoos who held that water was the first element and the first work of the creative power
this idea was not completely exploded even up till the 18th century
we find van helmont affirming that all metals and even rocks may be resolved into water and lavoisier so lately as 1770 thought it worth while to communicate an elaborate paper on the nature of water and the experiments by which it has been attempted to prove the possibility of converting it into earth
pythagoras perhaps the greatest of all greek philosophers it is known travelled very widely spending no less than twenty two years in egypt
he also spent some considerable time at babylon and was taught the lore of the magi
in the famous satire of lucian on the philosophic quackery of his day about 120 a
d the sale of the philosophers we have a most interesting account of the system of pythagoras

_customer what you say is really wonderful
_pythagoras besides what i have just told you you shall understand that you yourself who seem to be one individual are really somebody else
_customer what do you mean to say i'm somebody else and not myself now talking to you
_pythagoras just at this moment you are but once upon a time you appeared in another body and under another name and hereafter you will pass again into another shape still
after a little more discussion of this philosopher's tenets he is purchased on behalf of a company of professors from magna gr忙ca for ten min忙
the next lot is diogenes the cynic
apuleius says in the florida section xv
in reference to pythagoras that he went to egypt to acquire learning that he was there taught by the priests the incredible power of ceremonies the wonderful commutations of numbers and the most ingenious figures of geometry but that not satisfied with these mental accomplishments he afterwards visited the chald忙ans and the brahmins and amongst the latter the gymnosophists
the chald忙ans taught him the stars the definite orbits of the planets and the various effects of both kinds of stars upon the nativity of men as also for much money _the remedies for human use derived from the earth the air and the sea_ the elements earth air and water or all nature
but the brahmins taught him the greater part of his philosophy what are the rules and principles of the understanding what the functions of the body how many the faculties of the soul how many the mutations of life what torments or rewards devolve upon the souls of the dead according to their respective deserts
there is ample evidence therefore that the greeks had communication with and borrowed the philosophy of both persia and india at a very early date
what therefore remains for mortals to do
that there was intimate intercourse with india in very ancient times there can be no doubt
in addition to the classical sources of information collected chiefly by the officers of alexander the great seleucus and the ptolemies and which was condensed and reduced to consistent shape by diodorus strabo pliny and arrian within the first century before and the first century after christ we have the further proof of the fact by the constant finds of innumerable greek coins over a large portion of north western india and even at cabul
these so far as yet known commence with the third of the seleucid忙 and run on for many centuries the inscriptions showing that the greek characters were used in the provinces of cabul and the punjab even so late as the fourth century a
d the consideration of these coins of the gr忙co persian empire of the seleucid忙 naturally leads us to the consideration of the persians
i have already shown that the greeks and persians held intimate relations with each other as early as the fourth century b
c and from the speech of demosthenes against a proposed war with persia delivered in 354 b
c we may well believe that they had already had a long and intimate connection with each other
the passage rends thus all greeks know that so long as they regarded persia as their common enemy they were at peace with each other and enjoyed much prosperity but since they have looked upon the king of persia as a friend and quarrelled about disputes with each other they have suffered worse calamities than any one could possibly imprecate upon them
the persian empire was founded by cyrus about b
c 560 and rapidly rose to be perhaps the greatest power of the world of that age
the rise of the persian empire is not unlike that of the arabian power in regard to the wide range of conquest achieved in a very limited period
its actual existence from the foundation of the empire by cyrus in b
c 560 to the death of darius iii
was barely two centuries and a half
previous to the persian empire there existed three principal powers in asia the medes the chald忙ans or babylonish and the lydian
of these the medes and chald忙ans were the most ancient and their joint power would seem to have extended eastward as far as the oxus and indus
of these nations the babylonians were the most highly civilized and did time permit we might find much that would interest and instruct in examining the various facts relating to the arts and sciences amongst these nations
we know that arts and sciences must have been diligently cultivated amongst them and that magic and astrology were held in high repute
that the persians were well acquainted with other nations is shown clearly from the remains of their great city of persepolis where the sculptured figures represent many types of mankind the negro with thick lips and flat nose and with his crisp wooly hair clearly cut and the half naked indian with his distinguishing features being easily singled out from many others
persia held sway over a huge district of india the limits of this are not known but in addition they were well acquainted with a large portion of the north western part of india
the traditions and historical records of the persians are contained in the famous series of writings culled the zend avesta
these writings are it is thought of an age even before the persian dynasty was established and it has been shown by the researches of m
jones that there is indeed a great probability of the zend having been a dialect of the ancient sanscrit language
anguetil's great work on the zend avesta no less than 60 to 70 per cent
of the words are said to be pure sanscrit
as the oldest known language of persia was chald忙ic we are again thrown back on indian sources for the origin of the great book of the ancient persians
even the name of the priests of the persian religion of zoroaster mag or magi is of sanscrit derivation
the persians kept up an enormous army which was spread through all the various provinces and satrapies and consisted in great part of paid auxiliaries
in at least the later period of persian power the greeks were preferred to all others and in the time of cyrus the younger they composed the flower of the persian army and were employed in garrisoning most of the chief cities of asia minor
the description given by herodotus of the vast army and fleet prepared for the expedition of xerxes against the greeks gives us an idea of the extent of the persian power and of the wide range of countries and nations over which they held sway
the review held on the plain of doriscus was perhaps the greatest military spectacle ever beheld either before or since
herodotus enumerates no less than 56 different nations all of them in their national dress and arms
besides the persians there were medes and bactrians libyans in war chariots with four horses arabs on camels sagartians wild huntsmen who employed instead of the usual weapons of the time the lasso the nomadic tribes of bucharia and mongolia ethiopians in lions skins and indians in cotton robes phoenician sailors and greeks from asia minor
all these and many others were there assembled by the despotic power of the persian king
the system of government employed by the persians and the constant reports and tributes sent from every province to the central court of the king were well calculated to bring to it as to a focus the curious lore of the various nations who came in contact with or were subdued by them
their remarks on seeing the effigy of voltaire are too curious to be omitted
the persians were famed for their knowledge of astronomy and astrology and were said to have anciently known the most wonderful powers of nature and to have therefore acquired great fame as magicians and enchanters
the close relation between the persian religious traditions and those of the hindoos is very striking
according to mohsan the best informed persians who professed the faith of hu shang as distinguished from that of zeratusht believes that the first monarch of iran and indeed of the whole world was mahabad a word apparently sanscrit who divided the people into four orders the religious the military the commercial and the servile to which he assigned names unquestionably the same as those now applied to the four primary classes of the hindoos
they added that he received from the creator and promulgated amongst men a _sacred book in a heavenly language_ to which the musselman author gives the _arabic_ title of _desatir_ or regulations but the original name of which he has not mentioned and that _fourteen mahabads_ had appeared or would appear in human shapes for the government of this world
now when we know that the hindoos believe in _fourteen menus_ or celestial persons with similar functions the _first_ of whom left a book of _regulations_ or divine ordinances which they hold equal to the _veda_ and the language of which they believe to be that of the gods we can hardly doubt that the first corruption of the purest and oldest religion was the system of _indian_ theology invented by the _brahmins_ and prevalent in those territories where the book of mahabad or menu is at this moment the standard of all religious and moral duties
having established then the long and intimate nature of the persian intercourse with india let us see how it bears on our more immediate subject
the works on medicine which are known to exist and to have been written in persian are not very many in number but they cover a period of time of nearly 400 years
the oldest of them is of the year 1392 a
d and in it and its successors there are long lists of arabian authors whose works had been consulted and also v
